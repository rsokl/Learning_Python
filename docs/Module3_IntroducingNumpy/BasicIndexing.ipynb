    "# Introducing Basic and Advanced Indexing\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus far we have seen that we can access the contents of a NumPy array by specifying an integer or slice-object as an index for each one of its dimensions. Indexing into and slicing along the dimensions of an array are known as basic indexing. NumPy also provides a sophisticated system of \"advanced indexing\", which permits us powerful means for accessing elements of an array that is flexible beyond specifying integers and slices along axes. For example, we can use advanced indexing to access all of the negative-valued elements from `x`.\n",

    "```python\n",
    "# demonstrating basic indexing and advanced indexing\n",
    ">>> import numpy as np\n",
    ">>> x = np.array([[ -5,   2,  0, -7],\n",
    "...               [ -1,   9,  3,  8],\n",

Indeed, [NumPy's various mathematical functions](https://www.pythonlikeyoumeanit.com/Module3_IntroducingNumpy/VectorizedOperations.html#NumPy%E2%80%99s-Mathematical-Functions) have an optional keyword argument, `out`, which can be used to specify where to \"store\" the result of the mathematical operation.
