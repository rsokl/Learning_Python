    "## Vectorized Operations\n",
    "Recall that NumPy's ND-arrays are *homogeneous*: an array can only contain data of a single type. For instance, an array can contain 8-bit integers or 32-bit floating point numbers, but not a mix of the two. This is in stark contrast to Python's lists and tuples, which are entirely unrestricted in the variety of contents they can possess; a given list could simultaneously contain strings, integers, and other objects. This restriction on an array's contents comes at a great benefit; in \"knowing\" that an array's contents are homogeneous in data type, NumPy is able to delegate the task of performing mathematical operations on the array's contents to optimized, compiled C code. This is a process that is referred to as **vectorization**. The outcome of this can be a *tremendous* speedup relative to the analogous computation performed in Python, which must painstakingly check the data type of *every* one of the items as it iterates over the arrays, since Python typically works with lists with unrestricted contents.    \n",

This is done in place of an explicit iteration written in the native language code (e.g. a \"for-loop\" written in Python). \n",

Python is unable to take advantage of the fact that the array's contents are all of a single data type - it has to check, for every iteration, if it is dealing with an integer, a string, a floating point number, etc, just as it does when iterating over a list. This will slow down the computation massively.\n",

Thus the following sequences are summed over:\n",
