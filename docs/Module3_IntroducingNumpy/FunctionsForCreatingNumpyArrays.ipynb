    "# Functions for Creating NumPy Arrays \n",

    "\n",
    "# creating an array from a Python sequence\n",
    ">>> np.array([i**2 for i in range(5)])\n",

    "        0.55779525,  1.15574987, -1.98461337,  5.39771083, -7.81395192])\n",

    "## Creating Arrays from Python Sequences\n",
    "You can create an array from a Python `list` or `tuple` by using NumPy's `array` function. NumPy will interpret the structure of the data it receives to determine the dimensionality and shape of the array. For example, a single list of numbers will be used to create a 1-dimensional array: \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# a list of numbers will become a 1D-array\n",
    ">>> np.array([1., 2., 3.])  # shape: (3,)\n",
    "array([ 1.,  2.,  3.])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Nested lists/tuples will be used to construct multidimensional arrays. For example, a \"list of equal-length lists of numbers\" will lead to a 2-dimensional array; each of the inner-lists comprises a row of the array. Thus a list of two, length-three lists will produce a (2,3)-shaped array:\n",
    " \n",
    "```python\n",
    "# a list of lists of numbers will produce a 2D-array\n",
    ">>> np.array([[1., 2., 3.], [4., 5., 6.]])  # shape: (2, 3)\n",
    "array([[ 1.,  2.,  3.],\n",
    "       [ 4.,  5.,  6.]])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "A \"list of equal-length lists, of equal-length lists of numbers\" creates a 3D-array, and so on. Recall that using repeated concatenation, `[0]*3` will produce `[0, 0, 0]`. Using this, let's create two lists, each containing three lists, each containing four zeros; feeding this to `np.array` thus produces a 2x3x4 array of zeros:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# A list of lists of lists of zeros creates a 3D-array\n",
    ">>> np.array([[[0]*4]*3]*2)\n",
    "array([[[0, 0, 0, 0],\n",
    "        [0, 0, 0, 0],\n",
    "        [0, 0, 0, 0]],\n",
    "\n",
    "       [[0, 0, 0, 0],\n",
    "        [0, 0, 0, 0],\n",
    "        [0, 0, 0, 0]]])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You will seldom use lists to form high-dimensional arrays like this. Instead, there are other array-creation functions that are more amendable to generating high-dimensional data, which we will introduce next. For example, we will see that the `np.zeros` function is a much more civilized way to create a high-dimensional array of zeros. "
