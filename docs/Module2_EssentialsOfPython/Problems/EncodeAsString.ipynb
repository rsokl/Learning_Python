    "## Solution\n",
    "Our solution is broken down into three simple functions. `int_to_str` is used to map signed integers to English words. `item_to_transcript` is capable of mapping an object of any type to its string representation, in accordance with the prescription made by the problem statement. Finally, `concat_to_str` orchestrates these two helper functions, looping over each object in our input list, mapping each object to its string representation, and joining these strings with `' | '`. \n",

    "`int_to_str` plays a clever trick to convert each integer, digit-by-digit, into its string form - it calls `str` on the integer. This converts the integer into a string, which is a [sequence](https://www.pythonlikeyoumeanit.com/Module2_EssentialsOfPython/SequenceTypes.html). This permits us to access each digit of the integer and even iterate over them:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# casting an integer to a string makes its\n",
    "# sign and digits accessible via indexing/iteration\n",
    ">>> x = str(-123)\n",

    ">>> x[0]\n",
    "'-'\n",
    ">>> x[-1]\n",
    "'3'\n",

    "Thus, in total `\"-\".join(mapping[digit] for digit in str(n))` is responsible for casting an integer to a string, iterating over each of its digits and mapping them to their corresponding word using the [dictionary](https://www.pythonlikeyoumeanit.com/Module2_EssentialsOfPython/DataStructures_II_Dictionaries.html) that we defined in the function.\n",
    "\n",
    "`item_to_transcript` it an especially slick function. First, let's make clear the fancy use of the inline syntax here. This function:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def item_to_transcript(item):\n",

    "    if isinstance(item, str): return item\n",

    "    if isinstance(item, bool): \n",

    "    else:\n",
    "        return '<OTHER>'\n",

    "The latter uses the familiar pattern of [if-elif-else](https://www.pythonlikeyoumeanit.com/Module2_EssentialsOfPython/ConditionalStatements.html) statements and makes for a completely satisfactory version of the function. See, however, that each of the [multiple return statements](https://www.pythonlikeyoumeanit.com/Module2_EssentialsOfPython/Functions.html#Multiple-return-Statements) in `item_to_transcript` guarantees the same logic, in that if a condition is meant a value will be returned by the function and none of its subsequent code can be visited. That is, if `item` is an integer the second if-condition will evaluate to `True` and `int_to_str(item)` will be returned, immediately expelling the point of execution from the body of the function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ultimately, the preference of one function over the other is merely a matter of stylistic preference. You also have likely noted the peculiar in-line `if-return` expressions. These too are only stylistic choices; \n",
    "```python\n",
    "if isinstance(item, int): return int_to_str(item)\n",
    "```\n",
    "is no different from\n",
    "```python\n",
    "if isinstance(item, int): \n",
    "    return int_to_str(item)\n",
    "```\n",
    "The use of in-line `if-return` expressions in `item_to_transcript` does a nice job emphasizing the dictionary-like mapping behavior of the function: the form of the code suits its functionality nicely. That being said, these should generally be used sparingly. Some may call this a \"cute\" trick. And it is. This code is cute. I write cute code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, you may have noticed what looks like a redundancy in our code: our first `if` statement returns `'<OTHER>'` if `item` is `True` or `False`, and our final line of code returns `'<OTHER>'` if none of the preceding conditions were met (i.e. `item` is not a `bool`, `int`, `float`, or `str` type object). Why then did we not just merge our first `if` clause with this ultimate catch-all? The reason is that `True` and `False` are not only instances of the boolean type, they are also integers! `True` behaves like the integer `1` and `False` like `0`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> isinstance(True, int) and isinstance(True, bool)\n",
    "True\n",
    "\n",
    ">>> 3*True + True - False\n",
    "4\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, had we not taken care to check for booleans up front, `True` and `False` would have been mapped to `'one'` and `'zero'`, respectively, rather than `'<OTHER>'`. This is a relatively subtle edge case to catch."
