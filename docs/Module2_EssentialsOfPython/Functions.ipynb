    "- `<function signature>` specifies the input arguments to the function, and may be left blank if the function does not accept any arguments (the parentheses must still be included, but will not encapsulate anything).\n",
    "- The documentation string (commonly referred to as a \"docstring\") may span multiple lines, and should indicate what the function's purpose is. It is optional.\n",
    "- `<encapsulated code>` can consist of general Python code, and is demarcated by being indented relative to the `def` statement.\n",

    "### Accommodating an Arbitrary Number of Keyword Arguments\n",
    "We can also define a function that is able to accept an arbitrary number of *keyword* arguments, using the syntax: `def f(**<var_name>)` \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that a single asterisk, `*`, was used to denote an arbitrary number of *positional* arguments, whereas `**` signals the acceptance of an arbitrary number of *keyword* arguments. \n",

    "Because Python cannot foresee how many arguments will be passed to `f`, all of the keyword arguments that are passed to it will be packed into a *dictionary*, where a given keyword is set as a key (cast as a string) that maps to the corresponding value. This dictionary is then assigned to the variable `args`. Dictionaries will be discussed in detail in a [later section](https://www.pythonlikeyoumeanit.com/Module2_EssentialsOfPython/DataStructures_II_Dictionaries.html).\n",
