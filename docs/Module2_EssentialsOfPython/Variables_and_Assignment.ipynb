    "Variables permit us to write code that is flexible and amendable to repurpose. Suppose we want to write code that logs a student's grade on an exam. The logic behind this process should not depend on whether we are logging Brian's score of 92% versus Ashley's score of 94%. As such, we can utilize variables, say `name` and `grade`, to serve as placeholders for this information. In this subsection, we will demonstrate how to define variables in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, the `=` symbol represents the \"assignment\" operator. The variable goes to the left of `=`, and the object that is being assigned to the variable goes to the right:\n",

    "```\n",
    "Attempting to reverse the assignment order (e.g. `92 = name`) will result in a syntax error.  When a variable is assigned an object (like a number or a string), it is common to say that the variable **is a reference to** that object. For example, the variable `name` references the string `\"Brian\"`. This means that, once a variable is assigned an object, it can be used elsewhere in your code as a reference to (or placeholder for) that object:\n",
