    "The term \"object\" is a catch-all in Python, meaning anything that we can assign to a variable. Objects behave differently from one another according to what \"type\" a given object is. \n",
    "\n",
    "We reviewed several fundamental object types in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `int`, `float`, `complex`: the numerical types\n",
    "- `bool`: the boolean type. `True` and `False` are the only boolean-type objects\n",
    "- `NoneType`: the \"null\" type; `None` is *the only object that belongs to this type*\n",
    "- `str`: the string type\n",
    "- `list`: the list type\n",
    "\n",
    "The built-in function `type` permits us to check the type of any object:\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> type(3.2)\n",
    "float\n",
    "\n",
    ">>> type(True)\n",
    "bool\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The built-in function `isinstance` should be used to check if an object is of a specific type:\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> x = 2 + 3\n",
    ">>> isinstance(x, int)\n",
    "True\n",
    "```\n",
    "The only exception to this is if you want to check if an object is of the type `NoneType`, since this is only possible if the object is  `None`; thus it is \"cleaner\" to directly check this:\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> x = None\n",
    ">>> x is None\n",
    "True\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Objects of different types have different built-in functions available to them:\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> x = \"I am a farmer.. moo\"\n",
    ">>> x.upper()\n",
    "'I AM A FARMER.. MOO'\n",
    "\n",
    ">>> y = 0.5\n",
    ">>> y.as_integer_ratio()\n",
    "(1, 2)\n",

    ">>> z = [1, 2]\n",
    ">>> z.append(3)\n",
    ">>> z\n",
    "[1, 2, 3]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You should leverage the official documentation, for which links were provided throughout this section, whenever you are wondering how to best do a specific task with a given type of object.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a final reminder, we saw that that an integer in Python is able to hold a value with arbitrarily-many digits. A floating-point number, on the other hand, is restricted in the number of \"significant\" digits it can hold. Thus, where it is perfectly fine to check if two integers are exactly equal:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# checking if two integers are equal is great!\n",
    ">>> 2 + 2 == 4\n",

    "# checking if two floats are equal is lame!\n",
    ">>> 0.1 + 0.1 + 0.1 - 0.3 == 0.\n",
