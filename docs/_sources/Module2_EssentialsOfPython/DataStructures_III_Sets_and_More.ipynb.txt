    "# Data Structures (Part III): Sets & the Collections Module\n",
    "## The \"Set\" Data Structure\n",
    "The Python \"set\" is an *unordered* collection of *unique* objects. It is useful for:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Filtering out \"repeat\" objects in a collection, producing only its unique members.\n",
    "- Quickly checking for membership, as a $\\mathcal{O}(1)$ operation.\n",
    "- Efficiently comparing two sets of objects; e.g. if one set is a \"subset\" of another.\n",
    "\n",
    "A set uses a \"hashing\" scheme for keeping track of its contents. Thus, like a dictionary's keys, a set can only store *immutable* objects so that its hashes will never become invalid.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python's sets also support many familiar set-algebra operations, like taking the union or intersection of sets, as we will see below.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Creating a set\n",
    "You can initialize a set using the syntax: `{item1, item2, ...}`. Please note that this is distinct from the the dictionary-initialization syntax, which uses a colon to indicate key-value pairs:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# initializing a set containing various immutable objects\n",
    ">>> {1, 3.4, \"apple\", False, (1, 2, 3)}\n",
    "{False, 1, (1, 2, 3), 3.4, 'apple'}\n",
    "```\n",
    "A set can be constructed using the generator-comprehension syntax:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# initialization via set-comprehension\n",
    ">>> {i**2 for i in range(5) if i != 3}\n",
    "{0, 1, 4, 16}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "And, like the `list`, `tuple`, and `dict` constructors, `set` constructs a set from an iterable. You must use `set()` if you want to create an empty set, using `{}` creates an empty *dictionary*:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# using `set` to consume an iterable to construct a set\n",
    ">>> set(range(4))\n",
    "{0, 1, 2, 3}\n",
    "\n",
    "# creating an empty set\n",
    ">>> set()  # specifying `{}` would create an empty *dictionary*\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Redundant items are \"ignored\" when constructing or adding to a set. Thus *constructing a set is a great way to extract the unique items from a collection*: \n",
    "```python\n",
    "# filter repeat-items from a collection by feeding it into a set\n",
    ">>> x = [1, 2, 1, 2, 1, \"moo\", \"moo\"]\n",
    ">>> set(x)\n",
    "{1, 2, 'moo'}\n",

    "### Set operations\n",
    "Sets support membership-checking ($\\mathcal{O}(1)$) along with iteration ($\\mathcal{O}(n)$). Note that sets are unordered; thus the order of iteration is effectively random:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# checking membership in a set\n",
    ">>> 2 in {1, 2, 3}\n",
    "True\n",
    "\n",
    "# iterating over a set (the order of iteration is random)\n",
    ">>> [i for i in {\"a\", \"b\", \"c\"}]\n",
    "['b', 'c', 'a']\n",
    "```\n",
    "Python also provides the set-theoretic operations of union, intersection, and the relations of set equality and set inclusion. These can be invoked using operator symbols or by calling functions on the set explicitly. \n",
    "\n",
    "For an exhaustive list of the functions available to the set, please [refer to the official Python documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#set-types-set-frozenset).\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# demonstrating set-comparison operations\n",

    ">>> y = {\"a\", \"b\", \"e\"}\n",

    "\n",
    "# intersection: items in both x and y\n",
    ">>> x & y  # or x.intersection(y)\n",
    "{'a', 'b'}\n",
    "\n",
    "# difference: items in x but not in y\n",
    ">>> x - y  # or x.difference(y)\n",
    "{'c', 'd'}\n",
    "\n",
    "# symmetric difference: in x or y, but not in both\n",
    ">>> x ^ y  # or x.symmetric_difference\n",
    "{'c', 'd', 'e'}\n",
    "\n",
    "# check if set_1 is a superset of set_2\n",
    ">>> {1, 2, 3, 4} >= {1, 2}\n",
    "True\n",
    "\n",
    "# check if set_1 and set_2 are equivalent sets\n",
    ">>> {1, 2, 3, 4} == {1, 2}\n",
    "False\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "A set is a *mutable* object; it can be updated after it was created:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# sets are mutable\n",
    ">>> x.add(\"dog\")\n",
    ">>> x.remove(\"a\")\n",
    ">>> x\n",
    "{'b', 'c', 'd', 'dog'}\n",
    "```\n",
    "Because it is mutable, a set cannot be used as a dictionary-key, nor can a set be a member of another set. Python provides an immutable version of the set, `frozenset`, which has all of the functions of a set other than those that mutate the set:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# `frozenset` is an immutable version of a Python set\n",
    ">>> frozenset(x)\n",
    "frozenset({'b', 'c', 'd', 'dog'})\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-info\"> \n",
    "\n",
    "**Takeaway**: \n",
    "\n",
    "Python's set is an unordered collection of unique, immutable objects. It is an excellent tool for extracting the unique members from a collection of items. The set provides  $\\mathcal{O}(1)$ membership-checking along with a suite of set-algebra operations for comparing sets. `frozenset` is an immutable version of the set.\n",

    "### Named-Tuple\n",
    "A named tuple allows you to form a tuple whose members are named. Thus the user can access a member by name or via index. Otherwise the named tuple behaves just like a typical tuple. This facilitates clean, readable code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose, for instance, you want to keep track of the 3D-position and time of an event. You can use a named-tuple so that each space and time coordinate can be referenced \"by name\". In this way, the reader doesn't have to keep in mind that element-3 of your tuple corresponds to time:\n",
