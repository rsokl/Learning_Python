    "- A step-size, which permits us to take every item within the start & stop bounds, or every *other* item, and so on. It is important to note that a negative step-size permits us to traverse a sequence *in reveresed order*. \n",
    "\n",
    "The basic syntax for slicing is: `seq[start:stop:step]`, using colons to separate the start, stop, and step values.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# demonstrating the basics of slicing a sequence\n",
    ">>> seq = \"abcdefg\"\n",

    "\n",
    "You can omit any of these values or specify `None` in that entry to use the default value. You can omit the second colon entirely, and the slice will use a step-size of 1.  \n",
