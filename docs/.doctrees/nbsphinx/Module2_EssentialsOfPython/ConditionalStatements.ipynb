    "## Short-Circuiting Logical Expressions\n",

In Python, a logical expression is evaluated from left to right and will return its boolean value as soon as it is unambiguously determined, *leaving any remaining portions of the expression unevaluated*. That is, the expression may be *short-circuited*. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, consider the fact that an `and` operation will only return `True` if both of its arguments evaluate to `True`. Thus the expression `False and <anything>` is guaranteed to return `False`; furthermore, when executed, this expression will return `False` *without having evaluated* `bool(<anything>)`.\n",
