    "## For-Loops\n",
    "A \"for-loop\" allows you to iterate over a collection of items, and execute a block of code once for each iteration. For example, the following code will sum up all the positive numbers in a tuple:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "total = 0\n",
    "for num in (-22.0, 3.5, 8.1, -10, 0.5):\n",
    "    if num > 0:\n",
    "        total = total + num\n",
    "```\n",
    "The general syntax for a \"for-loop\" is:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "for <var> in <iterable>:\n",
    "    block of code\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Where `<var>` is any valid variable-identifier and `<iterable>` is any **iterable**. We will discuss iterables more formally in the next section; suffice it to know that every sequence-type object is an iterable. The `for`statement must end in a colon character, and the body the for-loop is [whitespace-delimited](https://www.pythonlikeyoumeanit.com/Module2_EssentialsOfPython/Introduction.html#Python-Uses-Whitespace-to-Delimit-Scope).\n",
    "\n",
    "The for-loop behaves as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Request the next member of the iterable.\n",
    "- If the iterable is empty, exit the for-loop without running its body.\n",
    "- If the iterable did produce a member, assign that member to `<var>` (if `<var>` was not previously defined, it becomes defined). \n",
    "- Execute the enclosed body of code.\n",
    "- Go back to the first step.\n",
    "\n",
    "To be concrete, let's consider the example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# demonstrating a basic for-loop\n",
    "total = 0\n",
    "for item in [1, 3, 5]:\n",
    "    total = total + item\n",
    "\n",
    "print(total)  # `total` has the value 1 + 3 + 5 = 9\n",
    "# `item` is still defined here, and holds the value 5\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This code will perform the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Define the variable `total`, and assign it the value `0`\n",
    "2. Iterate on the list, producing value `1`, define the variable `item` and assign it the value `1`\n",
    "3. Assign `total` the value `0 + 1`\n",
    "4. Iterate on the list, producing the value `3` and assigning it to `item`\n",
    "5. Assign `total` the value `1 + 3`\n",
    "6. Iterate on the list, producing the value `5` and assigning it to `item`\n",
    "7. Assign `total` the value `4 + 5`\n",
    "8. Iterate on the list. Having reached its end, a `StopIteration` signal it raised by the list, and the for-loop sequence is exited.\n",
    "9. Print the value of `total` (9)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Potential Pitfall\n",
    "Note that the variable `item` will persist after the for-loop block is exited. It will reference the last value from the for-loop iteration (in this case `item` has the value 5). That being said, *you should not write code that depends on the iterate-variable, outside of the context of the for-loop*. In the case that you try to loop over an *empty* iterable, the iterate-variable is never defined:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "for x in []:         # the iterable is empty - the iterate-variable `x` will not be defined\n",
    "    print(\"Hello?\")  # this code is never executed\n",
    "print(x)             # raises an error because `x` was never defined\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Because we are attempting to iterate over an empty list, `StopIteration` is raised immediately - before the variable `x` is even defined. Thus the code enclosed within the for-loop is never reached, and the subsequent `print(x)` statement will raise a `NameError`, because `x` was never defined!"
