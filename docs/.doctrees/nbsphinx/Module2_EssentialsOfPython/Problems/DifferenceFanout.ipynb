    "Given a list of numbers, for each number generate a list of the differences between it and $n_{fanout}$ (known as the **fanout** value) following numbers in the list. Return a list of all the lists generated for each number. For members in the list that have fewer than $n_{fanout}$ following members, calculate as many differences as possible.

    "We will naturally tackle this problem by performing nested for-loops. The outermost for-loop will loop over each number in the list. We will refer to this number as the \"base number\". We will want the inner for-loop to iterate ahead of the base number so that we can compute the differences between it and its $n_{fanout}$ neighbors. We will need to take care re-initialize our intermediate list of differences for each new base number, otherwise each subtraction will get appended to one long list. \n",

    "\n",
    "Note our use of [enumerate](https://www.pythonlikeyoumeanit.com/Module2_EssentialsOfPython/Iterables.html#Enumerating-iterables); this permits us to simultaneously access our base number, which we use in the subtraction, as well as its index-position within the list `l`, which we use to determine the neighbors. \n",
    "\n",
    "Next, you may be concerned that our inner-loop will attempt to iterate beyond the end of the list. Consider the case in which `base_number` is the final element in `l`, thus `l[i+1: i+1+fanout]` would be equivalent to `l[len(l): len(l)+fanout]` - the stopping point for this slice clearly reaches beyond the extent of `l` (assuming `fanout > 0`). Fortunately, this is not an oversight on our part. While indexing a list outside of its bounds will raise an error, recall that [a slice will automatically limit itself to be within bounds of a given sequence](https://www.pythonlikeyoumeanit.com/Module2_EssentialsOfPython/SequenceTypes.html#Handling-out-of-bounds-indices). That is, `l[i+1: i+1+fanout]` actually behaves like `l[min(i, len(l)-1): min(len(l), i+1+fanout)]` (assuming we are dealing only with positive indices and non-empty lists). Thus our inner-loop will naturally limit itself. In the case that `base_number` is the final element in `l`, the inner-loop will exit immediately, leaving `base_fanout` empty. Although somewhat obscure, this is an important aspect of Python's slicing mechanism to keep in mind.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Solution: difference_fanout using list comprehensions\n",
    "We can make judicious use of nested [list comprehensions](https://www.pythonlikeyoumeanit.com/Module2_EssentialsOfPython/Generators_and_Comprehensions.html#List-&-Tuple-Comprehensions) to simplify our solution. Although the syntax may appear to be convoluted at first glance, it permits us proceed without worrying about initializing multiple empty lists and appending to them at the right points in our nested for-loops\n",

    "## Extension\n",
    "Recall from [earlier](https://www.pythonlikeyoumeanit.com/Module2_EssentialsOfPython/Functions.html#Functions-are-Objects) that functions are, under the hood, just objects with some special operations that allow you to \"call\" a function. This means that you can pass other functions as parameters into a function. It is especially powerful, since it enables us to generalize the purposes of our functions. For example, we don't have to limit our function to just computing the **difference** between members and their following terms; we can apply **any** *binary operation*. Instead of finding the difference, we can calculate the sum or product or even concatenate two strings for a list of string. The possibilities are limitless. \n",
