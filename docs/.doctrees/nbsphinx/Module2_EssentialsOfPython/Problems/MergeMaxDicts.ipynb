The following function will correctly merge its two input dictionaries and is generally well-written, however, something insidious is afoot... Can you identify the bad behavior that will result from this function? \n",

    "    # populate `merged` with the mappings in dict2 if:\n",
    "    #   - the key doesn't exist in `merged`\n",
    "    #   - the value in dict2 is larger\n",
    "    for key in dict2: \n",
    "        if key not in merged or dict2[key] > merged[key]:\n",
    "            merged[key] = dict2[key]\n",
    "    return merged\n",
    "```\n",
    "Let's first see what this function does right. Recall that [iterating over a dictionary](https://www.pythonlikeyoumeanit.com/Module2_EssentialsOfPython/DataStructures_II_Dictionaries.html#Inspecting-a-Dictionary) will produce each of its keys one-by-one. Thus `for key in dict2` loops over every key in `dict2`. We then set a key-value from `dict2` mapping in `merged` if that key doesn't exist in merged or if the value is larger than the one stored in existing mapping. Given that `merged` is initialized to have the same mappings as `dict1`, this is a correct algorithm for merging our two dictionaries based on max-value.\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem with our function is that we inadvertently merge `dict2` *into* `dict1`, rather than merging the two dictionaries into a *new* dictionary. Recall that dictionaries are [mutable](https://www.pythonlikeyoumeanit.com/Module2_EssentialsOfPython/Variables_and_Assignment.html#Referencing-a-Mutable-Object-with-Multiple-Variables) objects and that the statement `merged = dict1` simply assigns a variable that references `dict1` rather than creating a new copy of the dictionary. Thus calling this function will *mutate* (change) the state of `dict1`, as demonstrated here:\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> exam_1 = dict(Alice=99, Bob=87, Cindy=65)  # equivalent to {'Alice': 99, 'Bob': 87, 'Cindy': 65}\n",
    ">>> exam_2 = dict(Alice=77, Bob=90, Cindy=78)\n",
    ">>> buggy_merge_max_mappings(exam_1, exam_2)\n",
    "{'Alice': 99, 'Bob': 90, 'Cindy': 78}\n",
    "```\n",
    "See that the value of `exam_1` has changed, and that it matches the output of our function:\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> exam_1\n",
    "{'Alice': 99, 'Bob': 90, 'Cindy': 78}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To reiterate, this is because the statement `merged = dict1` found at the beginning of our function *merely creates a reference to* `dict1`, not a copy of it. In the above example `exam_1` stored a class' exam-1 scores for each student. After passing it to our function, it now stores the max score for each student across two exams! \n",
