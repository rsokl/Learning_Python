    "\n",
    "- Filtering out \"repeat\" objects in a collection, producing only its unique members.\n",
    "- Quickly checking for membership, as a $\\mathcal{O}(1)$ operation.\n",
    "- Efficiently comparing two sets of objects; e.g. if one set is a \"subset\" of another.\n",

    "A set uses a \"hashing\" scheme for keeping track of its contents. Thus, like a dictionary's keys, a set can only store *immutable* objects so that its hashes will never become invalid. Unlike the other data structures that we have encountered, *there is no mechanism for retrieving an individual item from a set*. That is, there is no index or key that can be used to retrieve an individual member from a set. \n",
