    "# Working with Files\n",
    "This section will discuss the best practices for writing Python code that involves reading from and writing to files. We will learn about the built-in `pathlib.Path` object, which will help to ensure that the code that we write is portable across operating systems (OS) (e.g. Windows, MacOS, Linux). We will also be introduced to a *context manager*, `open`, which will permit us to read-from and write-to a file safely; by \"safely\" we mean that we will be assured that any file that we open will eventually be closed properly, so that it will not be corrupted even in the event that our code hits an error. Next, we will learn how to \"glob\" for files, meaning that we will learn to search for and list files whose names match specific patterns. Lastly, we will briefly encounter the `pickle` module which allows us to save (or \"pickle\") and load Python objects to and from your computer's file system.  "

    "## Working with Paths\n",
    "Suppose you are writing a Jupyter notebook where you are analyzing data that is saved to your computer. You will naturally need to detail the location where your data is stored on your computer's file system so that you can load your data. Let's suppose that this notebook is in the directory `my_folder` and that there is a directory, `data`, within it, which contains some text files with your data. Thus your directory structure looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "my_folder/\n",
    "  |-notebook.ipynb\n",
    "  |-data/\n",
    "     |-data1.txt\n",
    "     |-data2.txt\n",
    "```\n",
    "Now, if you are on a machine that is running Linux or MacOS, the path to `data1.txt` relative to the notebook is: `./data/data1.txt`. See that the character `/` is used as a separator used to denote subsequent directories in a path. On a Windows machine, the separator is `\\`, thus the path to your data would be written as `.\\data\\data1.txt`. We want to write our code so that it can be utilized, without modification, across operating systems. This where Python's fantastic `pathlib` module comes in handy.\n",
    "\n",
    "### pathlib.Path\n",
    "\n",
    "The standard library's [pathlib module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html) provides a number of classes that make it easy to work with file system paths across operating systems. We will limit our discussion to the `pathlib.Path` class, which will take care of all of our most pressing needs. This class allows us to write all of our path-related code in a single way, and it will convert the path to the operating system-appropriate format for us underneath the hood.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's begin by creating a `Path` object that points to the directory containing the present notebook:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# creating a path-object pointing to the present directory\n",
    ">>> from pathlib import Path\n",
    ">>> root = Path(\".\") # '.' means: the present directory that this code exists in\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Because I am running this code from a Windows machine, this will form a `WindowsPath` object automatically:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> root\n",
    "WindowsPath('.')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If I were running on a Linux or MacOS machine, it would have formed a `PosixPath` object instead. Fortunately, we need not worry about these details as these classes handle them for us! The `Path` class has many useful methods for us to leverage. First, see that it conveniently overrides the `/` operator (by implementing a [special method](http://www.pythonlikeyoumeanit.com/Module4_OOP/Special_Methods.html)) so that we can create a path to a subsequent directory. Let's see this in action:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# creating a path to the file 'data1.txt' in the subdirectory 'data'\n",
    ">>> path_to_data1 = root / \"data\" / \"data1.txt\"\n",
    ">>> path_to_data1\n",
    "WindowsPath('data/data1.txt')\n",
    "```\n",
    "See that the `/` operator, when used in conjunction with a `Path` instance, created a new path with the appropriate path-separator for the present OS. This is extremely convenient! \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's proceed to explore some other useful methods that `Path` provides us with. These methods enable us to inspect directories and files, create new directories, list all of the files in a directory, open files to for reading/writing, and much more. A complete listing of these methods can be found [here](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html#methods-and-properties) and [here](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html#methods), collectively; it is highly recommended that you take time to look through them.\n",

    "`pathlib` was introduced in Python 3.4. Although many 3rd party libraries have updated their file-I/O utilities to accept both strings and `pathlib.Path` objects (e.g. `numpy.save` can be passed a `Path` instance to tell it where to save a numpy-array), some libraries are late to the party and will only accept strings as paths. On such occasions you can simple convert your `Path` instance to a string by calling `str` on it, and then pass the resulting string-path to the file-I/O function. This is also a friendly reminder to accomodate `pathlib.Path` objects whenever you find yourself writing your own file-I/O functions!\n",

    "\n",
    "Whenever you instruct your code to open a file for reading or writing, you must take care that the file ultimately is closed so that its data is not vulnerable to being modified. Python provides the `open` context manager, which is designed to ensure that a file will be closed even in the event that our code raises an error.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following code opens the file \"file1.txt\" for writing:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# demonstrating the use of the `open` context manager\n",
    "\n",
    "# we will write to the file named \"file1.txt\", located \n",
    "# in the present directory\n",
    "path_to_file = Path(\"file1.txt\")\n",

In this case `open` is the context manager, and the variable we named `f` is the file-object that is opened within that context, which is delimited by the subsequent indented space. You can also call `open` directly from a `Path` instance:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "with path_to_file.open(mode=\"w\") as f:\n",
    "    f.write('this is a line.\\nThis is a second line.\\nThis is the third line.')\n",

   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "The complete documentation for `open` can be found [here](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#open).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Specifying the Open-Mode\n",
    "Specifying `mode='w'` indicates that we will be writing to the file anew - if the file already has any content, that content will be *erased* before being written to. The following are the available \"modes\" for opening a file:\n",
    "\n",
    "|Mode| Explanation |\n",
    "|---|---|\n",
    "|`r`| Open the file for reading text|\n",
    "|`w`| Open the file, **clearing its contents**, for writing text anew |\n",
    "|`a`| Open the file to write text to end of any existing content, thus \"appending\" to the file |\n",
    "|`x`| Open the file for writing text, failing if the file already exists |\n",
    "|`+`| Open the file for both reading and writing text |\n",
    "\n",
    "By default, these modes will read and write text utilizing the unicode (utf-8) decoding/encoding specification. That is, when you read data from your file system with `mode='r'` Python will automatically *decode* that binary data that was stored on your machine according to utf-8, which converts the binary data to written text stored as a string. Similarly, writing a string to a file in modes 'w', 'a', 'x', or '+' will presume that the string should be encoded into a binary representation (which is necessary for it to be stored as a file) according to the utf-8 encoding scheme.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can instead force Python to read and write strictly in terms of binary data by adding a `'b'` to these modes: `'rb'`, `'wb'`, `'ab'`, `'xb'`, `'+b'`. It is important to be aware of this binary mode. For example, if you are saving a NumPy-array, you should open a file in the 'wb' or 'xb' modes so that it expects binary data to be written to it; obviously we are not saving text when we are saving a NumPy array of numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# saving a NumPy-array to the file 'array.npy'\n",
    ">>> import numpy as np\n",
    ">>> x = np.array([1, 2, 3])\n",
    "\n",
    "# file must be open for binary-write mode\n",
    "# since we are not saving text\n",
    ">>> with open(\"array.npy\", mode=\"wb\") as f:\n",
    "...     np.save(f, x)\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Working with the File Object\n",
    "When we invoke `open` to open a file, the context manager produces an opened file object. The methods of this file object allow us to write-to and read-from the opened file (assuming that we have utilized the appropriate mode when opening it).\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# demonstrating the `read` method of the file object\n",
    ">>> with open(path_to_file, mode=\"r\") as var:\n",

    ">>> print(content)\n",
    "this is a line.\n",
    "This is a second line.\n",
    "This is the third line.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The following summarizes some of the methods available to this file object:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `read()`: Read the entire content of the file as a string or as bytes (depending on the open-mode)\n",
    "- `readline()`: Read the next line of text from the file, including the trailing `'\\n'` character\n",
    "- `readlines()`: Read in the lines of text from the file, storing each line as an string in a list.\n",
    "- `write(x)`: Write `x` (a string) to the file.\n",
    "- `writelines(x)`: Given an iterable of strings, treat each string as a line of text to be written to the file (the inverse of `readlines`)\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, it is important to note that the file object can be *iterated over*, and that each iteration will return an individual line of text from the file. This is the best way to read through an entire file line-by-line."

Please refer to [the official documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html#what-can-be-pickled-and-unpickled) for a discussion of the Python objects that can and cannot be pickled. "

    "## Saving and Loading NumPy Arrays\n",
    "NumPy provides its own functions for saving and loading arrays. Although these arrays can be pickled, it is strongly advised to leverage NumPy's file-IO functions. NumPy's standard binary file type used to store array data is known as an '.npy' file. The NumPy binary archive format, which stores multiple arrays in one file, is known as the '.npz' format.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's save the array `x = np.array([1, 2, 3])` to the binary file (not a text file) \"my_array.npz\". `numpy.save` and `numpy.load` will save and load arrays, handling all of the file opening and closing for you. Thus there is no need to use a context manager when using these functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> import numpy as np\n",
    ">>> x = np.array([1, 2, 3])\n",
    "\n",
    "# save a numpy array to disk\n",
    ">>> np.save(\"my_array.npy\", x)\n",
    "\n",
    "# load the saved array from disk\n",
    ">>> y = np.load(\"my_array.npy\")\n",
    "\n",
    ">>> y\n",
    "array([1, 2, 3])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use `numpy.savez` to save multiple arrays to a single archive file \"my_archive.npz\". Here we will save three arrays to the archive. We can specify the names of these arrays, via the keyword arguments that we provide, so that we can distinguish them when loading the archive.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# save three arrays to a numpy archive file\n",
    "a0 = np.array([1, 2, 3])\n",
    "a1 = np.array([4, 5, 6])\n",
    "a2 = np.array([7, 8, 9])\n",
    "\n",
    "# we provide the keywords arguments `soil`, `crust`, and `bedrock`,\n",
    "# as the names of the respective arrays in the archive.\n",
    "np.savez(\"my_archive.npz\", soil=a0, crust=a1, bedrock=a2)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Loading arrays from an archive is slightly more involved than loading a single array; we will want to open our archive file using a context manager and then load the arrays as we see fit. `np.load` can be used as a context manager in lieu of `open`. The file-object that it produces is our archive of numpy arrays, and it provides a dictionary-like interface for accessing these arrays:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# opening the archive and accessing each array by name\n",
    "with np.load(\"my_archive.npz\") as my_archive_file:\n",
    "    out0 = my_archive_file[\"soil\"]\n",
    "    out1 = my_archive_file[\"crust\"]\n",
    "    out2 = my_archive_file[\"bedrock\"]\n",
    "```\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> out0\n",
    "array([1, 2, 3])\n",
    ">>> out1\n",
    "array([4, 5, 6])\n",
    ">>> out2\n",
    "array([7, 8, 9])\n",
