Modules are individual `.py` files from which we can import functions and objects, and packages are collections of such modules. Detailing this packaging system will not only provide us with insight into the organization of the standard library and other collections of Python code, but it will permit us to create our own packages of code.\n",

    "Python provides a flexible framework for importing modules and specific members of a module. We have already seen in our work with NumPy that we can specify an *alias* in our import statement; this can be especially convenient for import modules with long names:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# the module object for numpy is returned with the variable name `np`\n",

    "array([2., 3.])\n",

    "\n",
    "Next, the pattern `from <module_name> import <thing1>, <thing2>, ...` permits us to import specific objects from the module instead of the importing the entire module as a whole. Let's import `square` and `some_list` from basic_module.py:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> from my_module import square, some_list\n",
    "I am being executed!\n",
    "\n",
    ">>> some_list\n",
    "['a', 1, None]\n",
    "\n",
    ">>> square(2)\n",
    "4\n",
    "```\n",
    "Note that the module is still being executed in full, however instead of producing the module-instance `my_module`, this imort statement instead only returns the specified objects that were defined in the module.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, you can specify `*` to refer to all of the module's attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# import all of the contents of `my_module`\n",
    ">>> from my_module import *\n",
    "```\n",

    "You can include in your module a list named `__all__`, which stores attribute names as strings, to restrict those attributes that are referred to by `*`. That is, if we included `__all__ = [\"cube\", \"some_list\"]` within `my_module.py`, then `from my_module import *` will only import `cube` and `some_list`, and not `square`.\n",

    "The absolute import syntax supports all of the variations the we enumerated above, such as aliased imports and `from <module> import <object>`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Relative Imports\n",
    "Relative imports use dots to indicate the relative position of the imported module, based on the location of the module doing the importing. For example, suppose that we want to import the `utils` module in our `model` module using a relative import statement:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from . import utils\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "See that `.` serves to represent \"the current package\". `..` then refers to \"one package above the current one\". Thus a relative import of `utils` from `face_detection/camera/calibration.py` would look like:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from .. import utils\n",
    "```\n",

    "from ..utils import some_util_func\n",
    "```\n",

    "## pip and conda: Package Managers\n",
    "\n",
    "Python packages can be shared worldwide. There are two widely-used Python package managers, `pip` and `conda`. `pip` downloads and installs packages from [The Python Package Index (PyPI)](https://pypi.org/), whereas `conda` downloads and installs packages from the Anaconda Cloud. Both `conda` and `pip` are installed as part of the [Anaconda distribution](http://www.pythonlikeyoumeanit.com/Module1_GettingStartedWithPython/Installing_Python.html#Installing-Anaconda). \n",
    "\n",
    "To install a package via `pip`, you execute\n",
    "\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "pip install <package_name>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To install a package via `conda`, you execute\n",
    "\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "conda install <package_name>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Both managers will install packages to your site-packages directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are substantial benefits for using `conda` rather than `pip` to install packages. First and foremost, `conda` has a powerful \"environment solver\", which tracks the inter-dependencies of Python packages. Thus it will attempt to install, upgrade, and downgrade packages as needed to accommodate your installations. Additionally, the default list of packages available via `conda` are curated and maintained by Continuum Analytics, the creators of Anaconda. To elucidate one of the benefits of this, installing NumPy via `pip` will deliver the vanilla version of NumPy to you; `conda` will install an [mkl-optimized version of NumPy](https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/numpyscipy-with-intel-mkl), which can execute routines substantially faster. Finally, `conda` also serves as [an environment manager](https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html), which allows you to maintain multiple, non-conflicting environments that can house different configurations of installed Python packages and even different versions of Python itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "That being said, there are some benefits to using `pip`. PyPi is accessible and easy to upload packages to; this is likely the easiest means for distributing a Python package worldwide. As such, `pip` provides access to a wider range of Python packages. That being said, `conda` can also be directed to install packages from custom channels - providing access to packages outside of the curated Anaconda distribution. This has become a popular method of installation for machine learning libraries like PyTorch and TensorFlow."
