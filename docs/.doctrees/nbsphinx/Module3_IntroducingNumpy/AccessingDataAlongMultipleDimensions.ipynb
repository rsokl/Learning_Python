    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Slice Indexing\n",
    "We can also uses *slices* to access subsequences of our data. Suppose we want the scores of all the students for Exam 2. We can slice from 0 through 3 along axis-0 (refer to the indexing diagram in the previous section) to include all the students, and specify index 1 on axis-1 to select Exam 2:\n",

    "array([ 95, 100,  87])\n",
    "```\n",
    "As with Python sequences, you can specify an \"empty\" slice to include all possible entries along an axis, by default: `grades[:, 1]` is equivalent to `grades[0:3, 1]`, in this instance. More generally, withholding either the 'start' or 'stop' value in a slice will result in the use smallest or largest valid index, respectively:  \n",

    "       [84],\n",
    "       [99]])\n",
    "```\n",
    "The output of `grades[:, :1]` might look somewhat funny. Because the axis-1 slice only includes one column of numbers, the shape of the resulting array is (3, 1). 0 is thus only valid (non-negative) index for axis-1, since there is only one column to specify in the array.  \n",
    "\n",
    "You can also supply a \"step\" value to the slice. `grades[::-1, :]` will returns the array of grades with the student-axis flipped (reverse-alphabetical order).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Negative Indices\n",
    "As indicated above, negative indices are valid too and are quite useful. If we want to access the scores of the latest exam for all of the students, you can specify:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# using a negative index and a slice\n",
    ">>> grades[:, -1]  # Latest exam scores (Exam 2), for all students\n",
    "array([ 95, 100,  87])\n",
    "```\n",
    "Note the value of using the negative index is that it will always provide you with the latest exam score - you need not check how many exams the students have taken.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Supplying Fewer Indices Than Dimensions \n",
    "What happens if we only supply one index to our array? It may be surprising that `grades[0]` does not throw an error since we are specifying only one index to access data from a 2-dimensional array. Instead, NumPy it will return all of the exam scores for student-0 (Ashley):\n",

    "```python\n",

    "```\n",
