    "# Measuring the Accuracy of a Classification Model\n",
    "Suppose that we are working on a project in which we have some model that can process an image and classify its content. For example, my `cat_dog_goose_other` function tries to classify whether a picture is of a cat (class 0), a dog (class 1), a goose (class 2), or something else (class 3). We want to measure the *accuracy* of our classifier. That is, we want to feed it a series of images whose contents are known and tally the number of times the model's prediction matches the true content of an image. The accuracy is the fraction of images that the model classifies correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "For each image we feed the `cat_dog_goose_other` model, it will produce four **scores** - one score for each class. The model was designed such that the class with the highest score corresponds to its prediction. There are no  constraints on the values the scores can take. For example, if the model processes one image it will return a shape-$(1, 4)$ score-array:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> scores = cat_dog_goose_other(image)\n",
    "# processing one image produces a 1x4 array of classification scores\n",
    ">>> scores\n",
    "array([[-10, 33, 580, 100]])\n",
    "```\n",
    "Here, our model has predicted that this is a picture of a goose, since the score associate with class 2 (`scores[2]`) is the largest value. In general, if we pass `cat_dog_goose_other` an array of $N$ images, it will return a shape-$(N, 4)$ array of classification scores - each of the $N$ images has $4$ scores associated with it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because we are measuring our model's accuracy, we have curated a set of images whose contents are known. That is, we have a true **label** for each image, which is encoded as a class-ID. For example, a picture of a cat would have the label `0` associated with it, a picture of a dog would have the label `1` and so on. Thus, a stack of $N$ images would have associated with it a shape-$(N,)$ array of integer labels, each label is within $[0, 4)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we have passed our model five images, and it produced the following scores:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Classification scores produced by `cat_dog_goose_other` \n",
    "# on five images. A shape-(5, 4) array.\n",
    ">>> import numpy as np\n",
    ">>> scores = np.array([[ 30,   1,  10,  80],  # prediction: other\n",
    "...                    [-10,  20,   0,  -5],  # prediction: dog\n",
    "...                    [ 27,  50,   9,  30],  # prediction: dog\n",
    "...                    [ -1,   0,  84,   3],  # prediction: goose\n",
    "...                    [  5,   2,  10,   0]]) # prediction: goose\n",
    "``` \n",
    "\n",
    "And suppose that the true labels for these five images are:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# truth: cat, dog, dog, goose, other \n",
    ">>> labels = np.array([0, 1, 1, 2, 3])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Our model  classified three out of five images correctly; thus, our accuracy function should return 0.6:\n",

    "### Unvectorized Solution\n",
    "A simple approach to this problem is to first loop over the rows of our classification scores. We know that each such row stores the scores for each class for a particular data point, and that the *index* of the highest score in that row gives us the predicted label for that data point (e.g. image in our hypothetical use-case). We can then directly compare these predicted labels with the true labels to compute the accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use the function `numpy.argmax` to get the index of the highest score, and thus the predicted class-ID, for each data point. Recall that NumPy arrays use [row-major traversal ordering](https://www.pythonlikeyoumeanit.com/Module3_IntroducingNumpy/ArrayTraversal.html#How-to-Traverse-an-Array:-Row-major-%28C%29-vs-Column-major-%28F%29-Traversal-Ordering), so performing a for-loop over `classification_scores` will yield one row of the array at a time.\n",

    "`numpy.argmax` is one of NumPy's [vectorized sequential functions](https://www.pythonlikeyoumeanit.com/Module3_IntroducingNumpy/VectorizedOperations.html#Sequential-Functions). As such, it accepts [axis as a keyword argument](https://www.pythonlikeyoumeanit.com/Module3_IntroducingNumpy/VectorizedOperations.html#Specifying-the-axis-Keyword-Argument-in-Sequential-NumPy-Functions). This means that, instead of calling `np.argmax` on each row of `classification_scores` in a for-loop, we can simply instruct `np.argmax` to operate *across the columns of each row of the array* by specifying `axis=1`.\n",
