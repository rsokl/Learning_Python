    "## How to Traverse an Array: Row-major (C) vs Column-major (F) Traversal Ordering\n",
    "Note the order in which `np.ndenumerate` iterated over `x`. It first traversed the columns within row-0 of sheet-0 of `x`, and then it traversed the columns within the row-1 of sheet-0, and so on. What is special about this traversal order? Why, for instance, didn't it traverse the rows within a given column instead? We can also see that there is not a unique ordering for a `reshape` function to adhere to. For example, the following reshape operation could sensibly return either of the following results:\n",
    "```\n",
    "  array([0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]).reshape(2, 3) -->  array([[0, 1, 2],  or   array([[0, 2, 4],\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Both arrays are of the appropriate shape and preserve the ordering of the original sequence of numbers, depending on how you traverse them. The left array preserves the ordering of the original data if you traverse the columns within a row, and then proceed to the next row. This is known as **row-major** ordering. The array on the right preserves the ordering if you traverse the rows within a given column, and then transition to the next column. This is thus referred to as **column-major** ordering. One ordering is not inherently better than the other. That being said, *NumPy always defaults to row-major ordering whenever one of its functions involves array traversal*.\n",

    "These two orderings are simple enough to follow for a 2D-array, but how do they manifest in arrays with higher dimensions, where we have to worry not only about rows and columns, but potentially \"stacks of sheets with rows and columns\" (which would be a 4D array) and so on? The generic rules are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Row-major ordering (C ordering) {NumPy's default}**: traverse an array by advancing the index of the *last axis*, first, until the end of that axis is reached, and then advance the index of the second-to last axis, and so on.\n",

    "<div class=\"alert alert-info\">\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: \n",
    "\n",
    "\"Row-major\" ordering is also referred to as \"C-ordering\" because this is the traversal method utilized in the C language. \"Column-major\" ordering, on the other hand, is also referred to as \"F-ordering\", because it is used by the Fortran language. NumPy functions, like `reshape` allow you to specify either `order=\"C\"` (which is the default) or `order=\"F\"` to control the order in which an array is traversed; these options thus correspond to row-major and column-major ordering. \n",

    "  1. Create an empty array of the desired shape: (2, 3, 4).\n",
