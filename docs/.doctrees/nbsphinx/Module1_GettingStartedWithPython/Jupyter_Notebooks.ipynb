    "**Before You Start This Section**: \n",
    "\n",
    "In the following section we will be using IPython or a Jupyter notebook to run our code.\n",
    "Presently, there is an incompatibility with these programs and a Python package called `jedi`, which typically is responsible for performing auto-completions in our code (when prompted by hitting `<TAB>`, which we will be doing below).\n",
    "It is really useful!\n",
    "\n",
    "First, let's check to see if we have an incompatible version of `jedi` installed.\n",
    "In your terminal (before starting a Python/IPython/Jupyter session), run\n",
    "    \n",
    "```\n",
    "conda list\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "And look for the line that starts with `jedi`\n",

    "```\n",
    "jedi                      0.18.0\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If you see that you have version `0.18.0` installed (as above), then you will want to downgrade it.\n",
    "In the same terminal, run the following command\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "conda install jedi=0.17.2\n",
    "```\n",
    "You should be all set once you have followed the prompts and the installation has completed!\n",
    "    \n",
    "Note that you will need to repeat this process if you [create a new conda environment](https://www.pythonlikeyoumeanit.com/Module1_GettingStartedWithPython/Installing_Python.html#A-Brief-Introduction-to-Conda-Environments) with IPython/Jupter installed in it.\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "In recent years, the Jupyter Notebook has become a massively popular tool for doing research-oriented work in Python and other languages alike.\n",
    "Its emergence marked a paradigm shift in the way data science is conducted. \n",
    "\n",
    "A Jupyter notebook is similar to the IPython console, but, instead of only being able to work with a single line of code at a time, you can easily edit and re-execute *any* code that had been written in a notebook. Furthermore, you can save a notebook, and thus return to it later.\n",
    "Additionally, a notebook provides many terrific features. For instance, you can embed visualizations of data within a notebook, and write blocks of nicely-formatted text (using the [Markdown syntax](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)), for presenting and explaining the contents of the notebook. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this way, the Jupyter Notebook stands out as an excellent tool for many practical applications. You could work on a notebook while you are working through sections of this website, for instance, testing out snippets of code, and answering reading-comprehension questions as you proceed through the text, and using markdown-headers to visually separate different portions of the notebook. When I do research, I am always creating Jupyter notebooks in which I write code that analyzes data, I plot various results, presented in different ways, and I write detailed markdown-text blocks to document my work. The end result is something that I can share with my labmates, and easily revisit months later without having to struggle to recall what I had done.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Jupyter Lab\n",
    "[Jupyter lab](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/) is a new web interface from Project Jupyter that provides a rich web-based interface for managing and running Jupyter notebooks, console terminals, and text editors, all within your browser.\n",
    "Among its useful features and polished user interface, Jupyter lab provides moveable panes for viewing data, images, and code output apart from the rest of the notebook.\n",
    "This is facilitates effective data science work flows.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is recommended that you peruse the [Jupyter lab documentation](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/overview.html) to get a feel for all of its added capabilities."

    "## Notebook Cells \n",
    "Whereas a Python console only allows you to work on one line of code at a time, a notebook allows you to write code within \"cells\" and to execute these chunks of code cell-by-cell. In the first cell, write the lines of code:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "x = 3\n",
    "y = 4\n",
    "```\n",
    "then press `<SHIFT>+<ENTER>`. This will execute all of the code within the given cell (in this instance, assigning the variables `x` and `y` with the values 3 and 4, respectively) and then creates a new cell below. In the next cell type the code:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "x + y\n",
    "```\n",
    "and hit `<SHIFT>+<ENTER>` to execute this code. The number 7 will appear beneath the cell - this, of course, is the value that is returned when `3 + 4` is evaluated: \n",
    "\n",
    "![jupyter notebook example](attachments/jupyter_early.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that the notebook \"knows\" about its variables across its cells. This doesn't just work from top to bottom - you can define `z = 2` in the third cell, and then execute code that references `z` in the first cell. What really matters is the *order* in which the cells are executed. Notice that `In[1]` denotes that the top cell with the first input-cell executed in the notebook, and `In[2]` denotes the second cell that was executed. \n",
    "\n",
    "Formally, the cells within a given notebook share a common \"namespace\": any variable defined in a cell can be referenced or redefined in any other cell within the notebook. On the other hand, separate notebooks are completely independent from one another. You can be working on multiple notebooks at once, and they will never \"know\" about one another. \n",
    "\n",
    "A major value of using a notebook is that you can rapidly edit these cells (say, change `x = 3` to  `x = 10`), and re-execute them to nimbly tinker with whatever code you are developing. Although simple, this is a hugely powerful environment for prototyping code. "

We'll use matplotlib, a Python library that is used for plotting data, and NumPy, the premiere library for doing numerical work in Python. We will import these libraries for use in our code. Next we'll define some mathematical functions. And finally, we'll plot these functions evaluated on a large number of closely-spaced points on the domain."

Using markdown cells allows you to create section and subsection headers for your notebook, you can [render LaTeX math equations](http://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/examples/Notebook/Working%20With%20Markdown%20Cells.html#LaTeX-equations), embed images and videos in your notebook, and much more.

    "### Using Jupyter Notebooks with Other Languages\n",
    "The Jupyter Notebook does not work exclusively with Python. A \"kernel\" can be developed in order to provide support for a given programming language in Jupyter. Indeed, kernels for several prominent programming languages are being developed for use with Jupyter: \n",
    "\n",
    "- [R](https://github.com/IRkernel/IRkernel)\n",
    "- [Julia](https://github.com/JuliaLang/IJulia.jl)\n",
    "- [Ruby](https://github.com/SciRuby/iruby)\n",
    "- [C++](https://github.com/QuantStack/xeus-cling)\n",
    "- [Haskell](https://github.com/gibiansky/IHaskell)\n",
    "- [Go](https://github.com/gopherdata/gophernotes)\n",
    "\n",
    "The ever-growing list of available kernels for use with Jupyter can be found [here](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter/wiki/Jupyter-kernels). It should be noted that these efforts are not all equally mature. For instance, whereas the Python and Julia kernels are robust, the Haskell kernel cannot run natively on Windows machines, and the C++ kernel is still in early development, as of writing this. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Jupyter Notebook Support in Visual Studio Code\n",
    "Native Jupyter notebook support was [recently added to Visual Studio Code](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/python/announcing-support-for-native-editing-of-jupyter-notebooks-in-vs-code/). This means that you can now edit Jupyter notebooks within the [Visual Studio Code IDE](https://www.pythonlikeyoumeanit.com/Module1_GettingStartedWithPython/Getting_Started_With_IDEs_and_Notebooks.html), and that you will benefit from added features like code-completion, debugging, and variable inspection."
