    "# Instances of a Class\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus far we have learned about the syntax for defining a new class of object, specifying its name, attributes, and methods (which are attributes that are functions). Once we leave the scope of the class definition, a class object is formed - the resulting *class object* is the singular object that encapsulates our class definition. We seldom will want to pass around or manipulate this class object once it is created. Rather, we will want to use it to create individual *instances* of that class. To be more concrete, `list` is a class object (remember that \"class\" and \"type\" are synonymous) - it is the same sort of object that is produced when a `class` definition is executed. As you saw in [Module 2](http://www.pythonlikeyoumeanit.com/Module2_EssentialsOfPython/Basic_Objects.html#Lists), we can use this class object to create individual *instances* of the list class, each one containing its own sequence of items.\n",

This first argument, `self`, actually represents the object instance of `Person` that is being created. Python will pass the appropriate object for `self` to `__init__` automatically, thus we need only worry about passing a value for `name`. \n",
