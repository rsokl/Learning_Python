    "# Special Methods\n",
    "In this section, we will learn about a variety of instance methods that are reserved by Python, which affect an object's high level behavior and its interactions with operators. These are known as special methods. `__init__` is an example of a special method; recall that it controls the process of creating instances of a class. Similarly, we will see that `__add__` controls the behavior of an object when it is operated on by the `+` symbol, for example. In general, the names of special methods take the form of `__<name>__`, where the two underscores preceed and succeed the name. Accordingly, special methods can also be referred to as \"dunder\" (double-underscore) methods. Learning to leverage special methods will enable us to design elegant and powerful classes of objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "These methods give us complete control over the various high-level interfaces that we use to interact with objects. Let's make a simple class with nonsensical behavior to demonstrate our ability to shape how our class behaves:\n",

    "This section is not meant to be a comprehensive treatment of special methods, which would require us to reach beyond our desired level of sophistication. The [official Python documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#special-method-names) provides a rigorous but somewhat inaccessible treatment of special methods. [Dive into Python 3](http://www.diveintopython3.net/special-method-names.html) has an excellent appendix on special methods. It is strongly recommended that readers consult this resource."
