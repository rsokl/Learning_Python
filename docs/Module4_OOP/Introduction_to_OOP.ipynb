    "\n",
    "Our first foray into the essentials of Python introduced us to the [basic object types: numbers, strings, and lists](http://www.pythonlikeyoumeanit.com/Module2_EssentialsOfPython/Basic_Objects.html). Likewise, our discussion of NumPy was centered around the [N-dimensional array](http://www.pythonlikeyoumeanit.com/Module3_IntroducingNumpy/IntroducingTheNDarray.html). These types of objects are distinguished in large part by the different functions that are bound to them. Functions bound to objects are known as **methods**. For example, where a string possesses methods designed to manipulate its sequence of characters, a NumPy array possesses methods for operating on the numerical data bound to that array.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Different types of objects can possess different methods \n",
    "\n",
    ">>> string = \"hello world\"\n",
    ">>> string.capitalize() # use the string-method `capitalize`\n",
    "'Hello world'\n",
    "\n",
    ">>> import numpy as np\n",
    ">>> array = np.array([[0, 1, 2],\n",
    "...                   [3, 4, 5]])\n",
    ">>> array.sum()  # use the array-method `sum`\n",

    "More generally, an object can possess data, known as **attributes**, which summarize information about that object. For example, the array-attributes `ndim` and `shape` provide information about the indexing-layout of that array's numerical data.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# accessing an object's attributes\n",

    "Popular STEM, data analysis, and machine learning Python libraries rely heavily on the ability to define custom classes of Python objects. For example, [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) defines a spreadsheet-like `DataFrame` class; [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/), [MXNet](https://mxnet.incubator.apache.org/), and [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) each define tensor classes that are capable of [automatic differentiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_differentiation), which is critically important for training neural networks. Understanding Python's class system will greatly improve your ability to leverage libraries like these (Shameless plug: refer to [MyGrad](https://mygrad.readthedocs.io) if you are interested in seeing a simple pure-Python/NumPy implementation of an auto-differentiation library). \n",

    "Moving forward, we will discuss the essential *class definition*, which will permit us to  define our own class (a.k.a. type) of object. Next, we will learn about creating distinct *instances* of a given object type and about defining methods. This will lead to our first encounter with *special methods*, which enable us to affect how our object type behaves with Python's various operators. For example, we can define how the `+` operator interacts with our objects. Lastly, we will briefly discuss the concept of class inheritance. \n",

    "## Class vs Type: An Important Note on Terminology\n",
    "Before proceeding any further, it is worthwhile to draw our attention to the fact that the terms \"type\" and \"class\" are practically synonymous in Python. Thus far, we have only encountered the term \"type\" to distinguish objects from one another, e.g. `1` belongs to the type `int` and `\"cat\"` belongs to the type `str`. However, we will soon study *class* definitions for making new types objects, and soon introduce functions like `issubclass` into our lexicon. That being said, know that *class* and *type* mean the same thing! There are historical reasons for the coexistence of these two terms, but [since Python 2.2](https://www.python.org/download/releases/2.2/descrintro/) concepts of type and class have been unified.\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, people tend to reserve the word \"type\" to refer to built-in types (e.g. `int` and `str`) and \"class\" to refer to user-defined types. Again, in the modern versions of Python, these terms carry no practical distinction."

Although they are not treated synonymously within the Python language - we will write class definitions, not type definitions, and we will use `type` to inspect an object and not `class` - these distinctions are merely relics of versions of Python long passed.\n",
