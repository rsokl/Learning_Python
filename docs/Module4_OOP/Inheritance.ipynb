    "# Inheritance\n",
    "A final topic for us to discuss in this introduction to object oriented programming is the concept of inheritance. Working with inheritance provides powerful abstractions and elegant code re-use - it permits a class to inherit and build off of the attributes of another class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's immediately consider an example of inheritance in action. Let's revisit the `Rectangle` class that we wrote in the introduction to this module.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Rectangle:\n",
    "    \"\"\" A class of Python object that describes the properties of a rectangle\"\"\"\n",
    "    def __init__(self, width, height, center=(0, 0)):\n",
    "        self.width = width    \n",
    "        self.height = height  \n",
    "        self.center = center\n",
    "\n",
    "    def __repr__(self):\n",
    "        return \"Rectangle(width={w}, height={h}, center={c})\".format(h=self.height,\n",
    "                                                                     w=self.width,\n",
    "                                                                     c=self.center)\n",
    "\n",
    "    def compute_area(self):\n",
    "        return self.width * self.height\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now suppose that we also want to write a `Square` class, such that only a single side length need be specified to determine its size. Recognize that a square is a special type of rectangle - one whose width and height are equal. In light of this, we ought to leverage the code that we already wrote for `Rectangle`. We can do this by defining a `Square` class that is a *subclass* of `Rectangle`. This means that `Square` will *inherit* all of the attributes of `Rectangle`, including its methods. Let's proceed with writing this subclass:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Creating Square, a subclass of Rectangle\n",
    "class Square(Rectangle):\n",
    "    def __init__(self, side, center=(0, 0)):\n",
    "        # equivalent to `Rectangle.__init__(self, side, side, center)`\n",
    "        super().__init__(side, side, center)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifying `class Square(Rectangle)` signals that `Square` is a subclass of `Rectangle` and thus it will have inherited the attributes of `Rectangle`. Next, see that we overwrote the `__init__` method that `Square` inherited; instead of accepting a height and a width, `Square` should by specified by a single side length. Within this new `__init__` method, we pass in that single side length as both the width and height to `Rectangle.__init__`. `super` always refers to the \"super class\" or \"parent class\" of a given class, thus `super` is `Rectangle` here.\n",
    "\n",
    "Having defined our subclass, we can leverage the other methods of `Rectangle` as-is. Let's see `Square` in action:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# create a square of side-length 2\n",
    ">>> my_square = Square(2)\n",
    "\n",
    "# using the inherited `get_area` method\n",
    ">>> my_square.get_area()\n",
    "4\n",
    "\n",
    "# a square is a rectangle with equal height/width\n",
    ">>> my_square\n",
    "Rectangle(width=2, height=2, center=(0.0, 0.0))\n",
    "\n",
    ">>> my_square.width == my_square.height\n",
    "True\n",
    "```\n"

    ">>> Square is not Rectangle\n",
