    "**What is a PEP?**\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be referencing several \"PEPs\" in this section. PEP stands for Python Enhancement Proposal. Any fundamental changes to the core Python language, the CPython interpreter, or the modules in Python's standard library must first be submitted as a PEP, which goes through an approval process. You can read more about the purposes and guidelines of PEPs [here](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0001/). The complete index of PEPs is available [here](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/).     \n",

    "\n",
    "[PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#code-lay-out) is a design document that specifies a coherent code style guide for the Python community.. It touches on a wide array of \"dos\" and \"don'ts\" when making style decision in your code. Many of these items are exceedingly simple. For example, PEP 8 calls for the inclusion of a single whitespace around binary mathematical operators; e.g.:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Do:\n",
    "x = x + 1\n",
    "\n",
    "# Don't:\n",
    "x=x+1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The biggest impact that this document has is that it guides Python users to write similar-looking code. Thus, writing code that adheres to PEP8 will ensure your code is easy for others to read, and vice versa. Note that the code you have encountered throughout PLYMI adheres to this style guide.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will make salient some of the PEP8 guidelines that are most pertinent to the variety of code that you have encountered in your reading thus far. That being said, you should take the time to read through [PEP 8 in full](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#code-lay-out), and consult it regularly when you write code. It won't take long for you to internalize most of its guidelines. Lastly, note that many [IDEs](https://www.pythonlikeyoumeanit.com/Module1_GettingStartedWithPython/Getting_Started_With_IDEs_and_Notebooks.html) have have tools called \"linters\" that will parse your code and warn you when your code is in violation of PEP8's guidelines. This is an excellent mechanism for ensuring that your code adheres to this style specification.\n",
    "\n",

    "We will being by studying some guidelines for writing idiomatic Python code. That is, these guide us to follow the syntax that the creators of Python intended for us to use. \n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, always leverage the negated operators `is not` and `not in`. For example `not x is None` and `x is not None` are functionally equivalent, but the latter is clearly preferable as it matches our native grammar.  \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Do:\n",
    "x not in collection\n",
    "\n",
    "# Don't\n",

    "\n",
    "# Don't\n",
    "not x is None\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Do not use parentheses to create unnecessary closures. Parentheses should be used for specifying function signatures, calling objects (e.g. calling a function), associating mathematical operations, defining generator-expressions, and grouping long multi-line expressions.   \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Do:\n",

For example, you can rely on the fact that empty sequence-objects will evaluate to `False` in conditional statements. \n",

    "### Naming Conventions\n",
    "\n",
    "Class names should use the `CamelCase` (aka `CapWords`) formatting convention, whereas functions and variables should use all-lowercase characters in their names. Underscores can be used in longer lowercased names to make them easier to read (i.e. `snake_case`).\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To be clear, there is nothing fundamentally correct about using `CamelCasing` for class names and `snake_casing` for functions and variable names. That being said, most Python users expect code to adhere to these conventions and will struggle to understand and use your code if you do not adhere to them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Constants - variables whose values are not to be changed anywhere within the code - should be specified using ALL_CAPS. Underscores can be used for improving readability.\n",

    "\n",
    "# Do:\n",
    "BOILING_POINT = 100  # celsius\n",
    "\n",
    "# Don't:\n",
    "boiling_point = 100  # celsius \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Variables that are only to be used internally within the code by developers can be identified using a leading underscore. For example, if you encounter the line of code `_use_gpu = True`, this means that the variable `_use_gpu` is only meant to be viewed and edited by the people who are actually writing the code. Note that this variable will not behave differently from `use_gpu` - the leading underscore is simply a visual indicator and nothing more.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use a trailing underscore when your variable name would otherwise conflict with terms reserved by Python. For example you cannot name a variable `class`, as this term is reserved by Python for defining a new class-object. Instead you could name the variable `class_`. This should be used only sparingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Paramount to all of this is that variables are given *descriptive* names.\n",

Type-hints would have likely alerted us to our misapprehension. \n",

    "Finally, it is also worthwhile to highlight two projects, [mypy](http://mypy-lang.org/) and [pyright](https://github.com/microsoft/pyright), which are used to perform static type-checking on your code based on your type-hints. That is, mypy and pyright will both automatically traverse your code and find potential bugs by identifying type conflicts in your code (e.g. trying to capitalize an integer) by checking their annotated and inferred types. These tools are especially useful for large-scale code bases. Companies like Dropbox and Microsoft make keen use of static type-checking to identify inconsistencies in their code without having to hit runtime errors. Keep mypy, pyright, and other type-checking utilities in mind as you mature as a Python developer and find yourself working on projects of growing complexity.

For example, suppose that we want to write a function that takes in a list of integers as an input. Using the built-in `list` object for our type-hint prevents us from indicating that the list should house integers. Using `typing.List`, on the other hand, supports a richer syntax for type-hinting: `typing.List[int]` specifies \"a list of integers.\" Familiarizing yourself with the `typing` module is the first step to writing good type hints.\n",
