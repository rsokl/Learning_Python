    "### Constructing a dictionary\n",
    "A nice syntax for creating a dictionary is to specify key-value pairs inside \"curly braces\": `{key1:value1, key2:value2, ...}`. As an example, let's construct a dictionary that maps types of foods to \"fruit\" or \"vegetable\". We'll start by mapping \"apple\" to \"fruit\", and \"carrot\" to \"vegetable\"\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# use `{key1:value1, key2:value2, ...} to create a dictionary that maps:\n",
    "#  \"apple\" -> \"fruit\"\n",
    "# \"carrot\" -> \"vegetable\n",
    ">>> fruit_or_veggie = {\"apple\":\"fruit\", \"carrot\":\"vegetable\"} \n",
    "\n",
    "# create an empty dictionary\n",
    ">>> {}\n",
    "{}\n",
    "```\n",
    "You can also use `dict` as a constructor to create the dictionary. It can be fed an iterable of key-value pairs, each of which is packed in a sequence, such as a tuple. \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# use `dict` to create a dictionary that maps:\n",
    "#  \"apple\" -> \"fruit\"\n",
    "# \"carrot\" -> \"vegetable\n",
    ">>> fruit_or_veggie = dict([(\"apple\", \"fruit\"), (\"carrot\", \"vegetable\")])\n",
    "\n",
    "# use `dict` to create an empty dictionary:\n",
    ">>> dict()\n",
    "{}\n",
    "```\n",
    "Lastly, Python also supports a dictionary-comprehension syntax, which mirrors the generator/list comprehension syntax covered earlier in this module:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "{key:value for key, value in <iterable of key-value pairs> [if bool(<condition>)]}\n",

    "{'apple': 'fruit', 'carrot': 'vegetable'}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Retrieving a value, given a key\n",
    "Now we can use this dictionary to \"look up\" if an item is a fruit or a veggie. Dictionaries support the same square-bracket \"get-item\" syntax as a list/tuple, but here a valid key is used as the index:\n",
    "```python\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Adding more key-value mappings\n",
