    "# A Quick Guide to Formatting\n",
    "This section provides a brief overview of the code formatting style that will be used throughout this text. You are not expected to understand the details of the code, here. This merely provides a guide for what is to come. \n",
    "\n",
    "Any code that is included in-line within plain text will be formatted distinctly as so: \"the variable `x` was updated...\". Such items will be distinguished with backticks wherever such formatting is not available. Take for example the following commented line within Python code:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# the variable `x` will be updated\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Python code will be displayed within distinct, colorized code blocks. These will typically begin with a comment, which is meant to serve as a caption that summarizes the purpose of the code block:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# demonstrating a basic for-loop\n",
    "cnt = 0\n",
    "for i in range(10):\n",
    "    cnt += 1\n",
    "\n",
    "#`cnt` is now 10\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The symbol `>>>` appears within code blocks to indicate \"console-style\" code, which distinguishes between code being entered by a user and the resulting output. The purpose of this is that it allows us to easily display the result of a computation without having to rely on calling the `print` function. For instance, the following code assigns the integer `1` to the variable `x`, and then displays the result of `x + 2`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# demonstrating the distinction of\n",
    "# input and output via >>>\n",
    "\n",
    ">>> x = 1\n",
    ">>> x + 2\n",
    "3\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The code blocks throughout a given section of the text should be understood to be persistent even if there is a mix of \"pure\" code blocks and \"console-style\" code blocks. For example, a function may be defined at the beginning of a section, and then referenced throughout the rest of that section:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# defining an example function\n",
    "def my_func(x):\n",
    "    return x**2\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We can spend some time talking about `my_func` and then see it in action:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# demonstrating `my_func`\n",
    ">>> my_func(10.)\n",
    "100.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, the input and output of an iPython console and a Jupyter notebook alike is displayed as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "2 + 3\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Running Code Snippets from this Site\n",
    "\n",
    "In PLYMI, we typically precede every code snippet with one or more commented lines.\n",
    "This is useful because it makes a page more \"skimmable\", since the code snippets essentially come with\n",
    "descriptive, self-explanatory captions.\n",
    "That being said, there is a downside to this. \n",
    "\n",
    "Python terminals don't like having multiple comment lines precede an input-prompt.\n",
    "E.g. if you paste and run the following code into a terminal\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# demonstrating the distinction of\n",
    "# input and output via >>>\n",
    "\n",
    ">>> x = 1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "you will get a syntax error.\n",
    "To fix this issue, simply exclude the comments when you copy this block to your clipboard.\n",
    "Running\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> x = 1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "will work without any issue.\n",
    "Keep this in mind if you ever find yourself having trouble running code that you copied from this site."
