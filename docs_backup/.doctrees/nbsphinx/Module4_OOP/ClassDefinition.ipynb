    "# Defining a New Class of Object\n",
    "\n",
    "This section will introduce the basic syntax for defining a new class (a.k.a. type) of  Python object. Recall that the phrase `def` is used to denote the definition of a function. Similarly, `class` is used to denote the beginning of a class definition. The body of the class definition, which is the indented region below a `class` statement, is used to define the class' various **attributes**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following defines a new class of object, named `MyGuy`, specifying four attributes `x`, `y`, `z`, and `f`\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# defining a new class/type of object\n",
    "class MyGuy:\n",
    "    x = 1 + 2\n",
    "    y = [2, 4, 6]\n",
    "    z = \"hi\"\n",
    "    \n",
    "    def f():\n",
    "        return 3\n",
    "\n",
    "# leaving the indented region ends the class definition\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Once this definition for a new class of object is executed, you can proceed to reference that object in your code. Here, we will access the various attributes of `MyGuy`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> MyGuy.x\n",
    "3\n",
    "\n",
    ">>> MyGuy.y\n",
    "[2, 4, 6]\n",
    "\n",
    ">>> MyGuy.z\n",
    "\"hi\"\n",
    "\n",
    ">>> MyGuy.f\n",
    "<function __main__.MyGuy.f>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "See that all of the attributes can be accessed using the \"dot\" syntax: `object.attribute_name`. The attribute `f` is a function, thus we can call it and it will evaluate as expected:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# calling the attribute f\n",
    ">>> MyGuy.f()\n",
    "3\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "An object attribute that is also a function is referred to as a **method**. Thus `f` is a method of `MyGuy`.\n",
    "\n",
    "`MyGuy` is the singular class object that embodies our class definition. It is akin to `list`, `str`, and `int`. We will use `MyGuy` to create objects that are *instances* of our class, in the same way that `\"cat\"` is an instance of `str`. More on this soon. "

    "\n",
    "Similar to function definitions, class definitions can contain effectively arbitrary Python code, and the definition has its own [scope](http://www.pythonlikeyoumeanit.com/Module2_EssentialsOfPython/Scope.html); however, *any* variables assigned within the class definition will be available as attributes. \n",
