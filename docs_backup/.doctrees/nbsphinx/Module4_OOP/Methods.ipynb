    "Recall that a method is an attribute of a class that is a function. For example, \"append\" is a method that is defined for the `list` class and \"capitalize\" is a method of the `str` (string) class. \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# create an instance of the `list` class/type\n",
    "# and invoke the instance method `append`\n",
    ">>> a = [1, 2, 3]\n",

    "Here we will encounter three varieties of methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "- instance methods\n",
    "- class methods\n",
    "- static methods\n",
    "\n",
    "whose differences are relatively minor but are important to understand. The functions \"append\" and \"capitalize\" are both examples of instance methods, specifically, as they are designed to be invoked by a particular list instance and string instance, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have already worked with the instance method `__init__`, which is special in that it is reserved by Python to be executed whenever class-initialization is invoked. Similarly, the special instance method `__add__` informs how an object interacts with the `+` operator. For example, `float.__add__` specifies that `+` will sum the values of `float` instances, whereas `list.__add__` specifies that `+` will concatenate `list` instances together. We will conclude our discussion of methods by surveying a number of these special methods - they will greatly bolster our ability to define convenient, user-friendly classes."

This may seem trivial but there is still a significant nuance that must be cleared up, which is that '`self`' is the defacto first-argument for any instance method. This is something that we encountered when working with `__init__`. Let's proceed naively so that we will hit a very common error, which will bring this matter to light. We begin by creating a class with an instance method that simply accepts one argument and then returns that argument unchanged:\n",

    "At first glance, this error message doesn't seem to make any sense. It is indeed true that `func` only accepts one argument - we specified that it should accept the argument `x` in its function definition. How is it that `inst.func(2)` specifies *two* arguments? It seems like we are solely passing `2` to our method. Herein lies an extremely important detail:"

    "### The `self` Argument\n",
    "We will want to define our instance methods in a way that anticipates that Python will automatically pass an instance object as the first argument. Thus if we want our method to accept $N$ external argument, we should define its signature to have $N+1$ arguments, with the understanding that Python will pass the instance object as the first argument. The accepted convention is to call this first argument `self`. There is no significance to this name beyond it being the widely-adopted convention among Python users; \"self\" is meant to indicate that the instance object is passing itself as the first argument of the method. Consider the following example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# demonstrate the use of `self` in instance arguments\n",
    "class Number:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, value):\n",

    "        return self.value + new_value\n",

    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# calls __init__, setting self.value = 4.0\n",
    ">>> x = Number(4.0)\n",
    "\n",
    "# `x` gets passed to `self`\n",

    ">>> Number.add(x, 2.0)\n",
    "6.0\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Note the utility of having `self` be automatically passed in as an argument to both `__init__` and `add`. An instance method is meant to have access to the instance object that is calling it - when you call `capitalize` from a string instance, it is obvious that you want to capitalize *that* specific string. It would be tedious and redundant if Python did not manage that automatically. \n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we will see that we can also define class-methods, which automatically have *class objects* get passed as their first arguments, and static methods, which do not have any objects passed to them under the hood."
