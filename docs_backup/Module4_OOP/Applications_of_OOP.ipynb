    "We have spent a considerable amount of time learning about the syntax and definitions of classes, class objects, instances, and methods. Let's take a moment to gather our knowledge and create a useful class. This will help develop a sense for the ways in which object oriented programming can be useful for us. We will try to take care to make some recommendations when one should and shouldn't define their own classes. "

    "## Shopping List\n",
    "Let's create a shopping list class, where an instance of this class stores a list of item-names (strings) to be purchased and a list of names that have already been purchased. We will write an `__init__` function that accepts one or more strings, which will be added to the shopping list. Then, we will create methods that will allow us to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- add new items to the shopping list\n",
    "- mark items on the list as \"purchased\"\n",
    "- remove items, purchased or not, from the list\n",
    "- list the name of the items to-be purchased (in alphabetical order)\n",
    "- list the name of the items have been purchased (in alphabetical order)\n",
    "\n",
    "We do not want redundant items to be included on our shopping list - if someone enters \"apples\" twice, we should only list it once. Thus we will make use of [sets](http://www.pythonlikeyoumeanit.com/Module2_EssentialsOfPython/DataStructures_III_Sets_and_More.html#The-%E2%80%9CSet%E2%80%9D-Data-Structure), which store unique elements, to store the items on our list.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, we will want our methods to accept a variable that is either a single item name (a string) or multiple item names (a list/tuple/iterable of strings). To accommodate this, if we receive a sole string as an input, we will place it in a list before carrying on. This will ensure that we are always working with an iterable containing a string.\n"
