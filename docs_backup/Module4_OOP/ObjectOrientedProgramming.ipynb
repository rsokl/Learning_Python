    "# Object Oriented Programming\n",

However, we have been limited in the types of data we can work with. This section introduces the concept of object-oriented programming (often referred to as OOP).\n",
    "\n",
    "An *object* bundles together data and functions. For example, a Python [List](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html) is an object. It contains data (its elements) and functions (such as `sort`, `append` and `count`)."

    "## Defining Objects\n",
    "When we define our own objects, we will write a *class* containing data and functions. Let's start with a simple example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Rectangle:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, width=1, height=1):\n",
    "        self.width = width\n",
    "        self.height = height\n",
    "        \n",
    "    def get_area(self):\n",
    "        return self.width * self.height\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We've defined a `Rectangle` object, which has two pieces of data that it keeps track of: `width` and `height`. It also has a function `get_area` that we can invoke, in much the same way we would create a list and call its `append` function. We can create a `Rectangle` in much the same way we might create a list:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> rect = Rectangle(2, 3)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The `__init__` function is a special function that is executed when we create an object. Its purpose is to perform any *initialization* (hence its name) that ought to occur when the object is being created. In our case, we initialize the width and height of our `Rectangle`. Note that a parameter of our `__init__` method is `self`, which refers to the object we are creating.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can call functions that our `Rectangle` has associated with it:\n",

    "## Inheritance\n",
    "Working with objects provides powerful abstractions and an incredible amount of code re-use. For example, let's implement a `Square` class. One way to write `Square` would be the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Square:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, side=1):\n",
    "        self.side = side\n",
    "        \n",
    "    def get_area(self):\n",
    "        return self.side ** 2\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "However, we can take advantage of the code we've already written for `Rectangle`. We know that a square is a rectangle. Inheritance exactly follows this *is a* relationship. We can thus write our `Square` class to *inherit from* our `Rectangle` class:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Square(Rectangle):\n",
    "    def __init__(self, side=1):\n",
    "        super().__init__(side, side)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we're saying that a `Square` *is a* `Rectangle`. This means that `Square` *inherits* all of the data and functions inside `Rectangle`. Let's make sure:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> my_square = Square(2)\n",
    ">>> my_square.get_area()\n",
    "4\n",
    "\n",
    ">>> my_square.width\n",
    "2\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The `super()` call refers to `Square`'s *super* class, or *parent* class, which is `Rectangle`. We're calling the `__init__` method of `Rectangle`, and passing it `side` for both `width` and `height`.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this way, we're able to re-use all the code that we already wrote for `Rectangle` so that we don't have to re-implement our `get_area` function. We can also show that our square is a rectangle, but our rectangle is not a square:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> isinstance(my_square, Square)\n",
    "True\n",
    "\n",
    ">>> isinstance(my_square, Rectangle)\n",

    "We'll take some time now to walk through some of the details behind what we implemented. By now, the `__init__` function should look pretty familiar to you. A `Rational` object can take 0 parameters (which gives you the `Rational` $\\frac{0}{1}$), 1 parameter (which gives you $\\frac{a}{1}$), or 2 parameters (which gives you $\\frac{a}{b}$). We've overloaded several common operators:\n",
    "\n",
    "##### __add__\n",
    "By overloading the `__add__` function, we allow the `+` operator to be used with `Rational`s. For example, we can add two `Rational`s together:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> Rational(7, 2) + Rational(1, 7)\n",
    "Rational(51, 14)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### __radd__\n",
    "This may look a little strage at first; especially when you see that this function just calls `__add__`. Under the hood, our `__add__` function call really looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> r1 = Rational(1, 3)\n",
    ">>> r2 = Rational(2, 5)\n",
    ">>> r1.__add__(r2)  # same as r1 + r2\n",
    "Rational(11, 15)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "That call is made because `r1` appears before the `+` operator. In some cases, the operand on the left might not have a `+` operator defined that is compatible with the type of operand on the right:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> r1 = Rational(1, 3)\n",
    ">>> int(2).__add__(r1)\n",
    "NotImplemented\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, an `int` doesn't know anything about our `Rational` class. Python is unable to resolve the `+` operator in that scenario. However, it will then look to see whether our `Rational` class has the `__radd__` function implemented, which means \"add on the right\" and is called when our object is on the right of the `+`. Now, our `Rational` class doesn't have an `__radd__` function that works with an `int` so unfortunately this won't work either. However, we can still observe that this is what's happening by examining the error message:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> 2 + Rational(1, 3)\n",
    "AttributeError: 'int' object has no attribute 'denom'\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The call fails on the line\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "num = self.num * other.denom + self.denom * other.num\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "in our `Rational` class. Python unsuccessfully tries to resolve the `int` class's `__add__` operator, then attempts to use our `Rational`'s `__radd__`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since addition is commutative, we can simply call the `__add__` function from `__radd__` and things work like we expect them to. Notice that our `__rsub__` implementation is different from our `__sub__` implementation, since subtraction is not commutative. We can observe that these give different results, as they should:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> Rational(1) - Rational(1, 3)\n",
    "Rational(2, 3)\n",
    "\n",
