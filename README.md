# Python Like You Mean It
This repository contains the source material for the website [Python Like You Mean It](https://rsokl.github.io/Learning_Python/index.html). It is not yet at 1.0 (stable public release). See the issues section to find tasks that need doing. Please share this website with others, but not this source material. This is a private repo, and I have added people in good faith that they will not distribute the source material.
 
# How To Contribute
Contributions to this project are very welcome!  I will be sure to credit any/all contributions (unless your want to remain anonymous). Some great ways to help out are to:
- proofread (via [Pull Request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/))
- write reading comprehension exercises (create a new [issue](https://github.com/LLrsokl/BWSI_2018/issues))
- provide general feedback (create a new [issue](https://github.com/LLrsokl/BWSI_2018/issues))
- "dummy test" assignments (create a new [issue](https://github.com/LLrsokl/BWSI_2018/issues))
 
I have posted a number of "To-Do" tasks in this project's [issues](https://github.com/LLrsokl/BWSI_2018/issues) page, and I will be adding to these as this project progresses. Included are requests for proofreading and exercises. Please post within an issue if you are working on a to-do item, so multiple people don't end up working on the same task. General feedback on content is also hugely valuable, so feel free to open a new issue to provide your feedback on any of the material.

[Here is a nice Markdown "cheat sheet"](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) for looking up how to make tables, code-blocks, etc., in Markdown.

### Making a Pull Request
If you want to submit a change to some of the content (e.g. correcting typos), do the following:
1. Clone this repository
2. Create a new branch, appropriately named for whatever task you are performing: `git checkout -b your_branch_name`
3. Check out your new branch and commit any changes you make to it
4. Push your branch: `git push origin your_branch_name` (you should have permission to do this, if you are added as a "contributor" to this project)
5. Create a [Pull Request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/)) from your branch into the master branch.
