A context manager will make sure that when you're finished reading a file, you don't have any resoures that are held open unnecessarily. For safety, you can always manage file IO from inside a context manager. Using a context manger looks something like this:\n",

    "When we `open` a file, we need to specify a *mode* for interacting with the file that tells Python how we'll use the file. For example, we can specify whether we want to read from the file or write to it. Common modes we use will be `'r'` to read, `'w'` to write, and `'a'` to append. The [documentation](https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/functions.html#open) covers all the available modes."
