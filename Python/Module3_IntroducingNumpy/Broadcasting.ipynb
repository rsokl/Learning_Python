    "# Array Broadcasting\n",
    "## A Simple Example of Array Broadcasting\n",
    "In this section, we will discuss the NumPy's array broadcasting mechanism for performing vectorized mathematical operations on arrays of *unequal* shape. Let's immediately take an example into consideration to see array broadcasting in action. Suppose you have a grade book for 6 students,each of whom have taken 3 exams; naturally, you store these scores in a shape-(6,3) array:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# grades for 6 students who have taken 3 exams\n",
    ">>> import numpy as np\n",
    ">>> grades\n",
    "array([[ 0.79,  0.84,  0.84],\n",
    "       [ 0.87,  0.93,  0.78],\n",
    "       [ 0.77,  1.  ,  0.87],\n",
    "       [ 0.66,  0.75,  0.82],\n",
    "       [ 0.84,  0.89,  0.76],\n",
    "       [ 0.83,  0.71,  0.85]])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We might be interested to how each of these scores compare to the mean score for that specific exam. Based on our discussion from the last section, we can easily compute the mean-score for each exam (rounded to 2 decimal places):\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# compute the mean score for each exam (rounded to 2 decimal places)\n",
    ">>> mean_exam_scores = grades.mean(axis=0)\n",
    ">>> mean_exam_scores = np.round(mean_exam_scores, 2)\n",
    ">>> mean_exam_scores\n",
    "array([ 0.79,  0.85,  0.82])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "`grades` is a shape-(6,3) array and `mean_exam_scores` is a shape-(3,) array, and we want to compute the offset of each exam score from its respective mean. At first glance, it seems like we will have to loop over each row of our `grades` array and subtract from it the `mean_exam_scores` as so:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Using a for-loop to compute score offsets.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Shape-(6,3) array that will store (score - mean) for each\n",
    "# exam score.\n",
    "score_offset = np.zeros_like(grades)\n",
    "\n",
    "# iterates over each row of `grades`\n",
    "for n, scores_per_student in enumerate(grades):\n",
    "    # `scores_per_student` is a shape-(3,) array of exam scores\n",
    "    # for a given student. This matches the shape of\n",
    "    # `mean_exam_scores`, thus we can perform this subtraction\n",
    "    score_offset[n] = scores_per_student - mean_exam_scores\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Given our discussion of vectorized operations from the last section, you should recoil at the sight of a for-loop in code that is performing array-arithmetic. We might as well get out our abacuses and spreadsheets at this point. NumPy provides a mechanism called array-broadcasting, which allows us to compute these offsets in a concise, vectorized way:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Using broadcasting to subtract a shape-(3,) array\n",
    "# from a shape-(6,3) array.\n",
    ">>> score_offset = grades - mean_exam_scores\n",
    ">>> score_offset\n",
    "array([[ 0.  , -0.01,  0.02],\n",
    "       [ 0.08,  0.08, -0.04],\n",
    "       [-0.02,  0.15,  0.05],\n",
    "       [-0.13, -0.1 ,  0.  ],\n",
    "       [ 0.05,  0.04, -0.06],\n",
    "       [ 0.04, -0.14,  0.03]])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "When you invoke `grades - mean_exam_scores`, NumPy will recognize that `mean_exam_scores` has the same shape as each row of `grades` and thus it will apply the subtraction operation on *each* row of `grades` with `mean_exam_scores`. What has transpired here is an example of *array broadcasting*. NumPy has effectively replicated the content of `mean_exam_scores` such that it is now a shape-(6,3) array, which is thus compatible for subtraction with `grades`. That is, the content of `mean_exam_scores` has effectively been *broadcasted* to fill a shape-(6,3) array:\n",

    "The word \"effectively\" is used here because NumPy doesn't really create this broadcasted version of `mean_exam_scores` behind the scenes; it is able to do the necessary computations without having to redundantly copy the contents of `mean_exam_scores` into a shape-(6,3) array. Doing so would be a waste of memory and computation.

For example, if the center of mass is $(0.5, 1)$, and the absolute position of point is $(2, 3)$, then its position *relative* to the center of mass is simply $(2, 3) - (0.5, 1) = (1.5, 2)$\n",

    "Array broadcasting cannot accommodate any combination of array shapes. For example, a (7,5)-shape array cannot be broadcast to be added to a shape-(11,3) array. Trying to add two such arrays would produce a `ValueError`. To determine if two arrays are broadcast-compatible, line up their shapes so that their trailing dimensions are aligned, and then check each pair of aligned dimensions satisfy either of these conditions:\n",
