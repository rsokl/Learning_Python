A generator, on the otherhand, *does not store any items*. Instead, it stores the instructions for generating each of its members in sequence, and stores its iteration state - meaning that the generator will know if it has generated its second member, and will thus generate its third member the next time it is iterated on. The whole point of this is that you can use a generator to produce a long sequence of items, without having to store them all in memory."

    "#  stop: 7  (excluded)\n",
    "#  step: 1\n",
    "for i in range(2, 7, 1):\n",

    "    # prints: 2.. 3.. 4.. 5.. 6\n",

For short sequences, this seems to be a rather paltry savings; this is not the case for long sequences. The following graph compares the memory consumption used when defining a generator for the sequence of number $0-N$ using `range`, compared to storing the sequence in a list:\n",

    "#### Storing generators\n",
    "Just like we saw with the `range` generator, defining a generator using a comprehension does *not* perform any computations or consumer any memory beyond defining the rules for producing the sequence of data. See what happens when we try to print this generator:\n",

    "<generator object <genexpr> at 0x000001E768FE8A40>\n",

    "This output simply indicates that `gen` stores a generator-expression at the memory address `0x000001E768FE8A40`; this is simply where the instructions for generating our sequence of squared numbers is stored. `gen` will not produce any results until we iterate over it. For this reason, generators cannot be inspected in the same way that lists and other iterable containers can - you cannot query the length of a generator nor can you index into it.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-success\"> \n",
