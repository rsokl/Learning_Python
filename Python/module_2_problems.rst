Module 2: Problems
==================
This section presents the reader with problems to exercise their understanding of the materials that were presented in the Essentials of Python module. They are meant to be worked through after having read through the module in its entirety. Accompanying each problem is a solution and explanation, which include links to the relevant sections of Python Like You Mean It. The solutions are also designed to emphasize good coding practices.
These problems were written by former students of mine and PLYMI readers. Have you written a piece of code that would make for a good exercise for a Python user? Consider submitting a problem and solution to be included here!
