    "# A Quick Guide to Formatting\n",
    "This section provides a brief overview of the code formatting style that will be used throughout this text. Any code that is included in-line within plain text will be formatted distinctly as so: \"the variable `x` was updated...\". Such items will be distinguished with backticks wherever such formatting is not available. Take for example the following commented line within Python code:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# the variable `x` will be updated\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Python code will be displayed within distinct, colorized code blocks. These will typically begin with a comment, which is meant to serve as a caption that summarizes the purpose of the code block:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# demonstrating a basic for-loop\n",
    "cnt = 0\n",
    "for i in range(10):\n",
    "    cnt += 1\n",
    "\n",
    "#`cnt` is now 10\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The symbol `>>>` appears within code blocks to indicate \"console-style\" code, which distinguished between code being entered by a user and the resulting output. The purpose of this is that it allows us to easily display the result of a computation without having to rely on calling the `print` function. For instance, the following code assigns the variable `x` to the integer `1`, and then displays the result of `x + 2`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# demonstrating the distinction of\n",
    "# input and output via >>>\n",
    "\n",
    ">>> x = 1\n",
    ">>> x + 2\n",
    "3\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The code blocks throughout a given section of the text should be understood to be persistent even if there is a mix of \"pure\" code blocks and \"console-style\" code blocks. For example, a function may be defined at the beginning of a section, and then referenced throughout the rest of that section:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# defining an example function\n",
    "def my_func(x):\n",
    "    return x**2\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We can spend some time talking about `my_func` and then see it in action:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# demonstrating `my_func`\n",
    ">>> my_func(10.)\n",
    "100.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, the input and output of an iPython console and a Jupyter notebook alike is displayed as follows:"
