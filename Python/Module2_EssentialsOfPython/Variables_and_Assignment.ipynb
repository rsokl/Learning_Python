    "Variables permit us to write code that is flexible and amendable to repurpose. Suppose we want to write code that logs a student's grade on an exam. The logic behind this process should not depend on whether we are logging Brian's score of 92% versus Ashley's score of 94%. As such, we can utilize variables, say `name` and `grade`, to serve as placeholders for this information. In this subsection, we will demonstrate how to define variables in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, the `=` symbol represents the \"assignment\" operator. The variable goes to the left of `=`, and the object that is being assigned to the variable goes to the right:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "name = \"Brian\"  # the variable `name` is being assigned the string \"Brian\"\n",
    "grade = 92      # the variable `grade` is being assigned the integer 92\n",
    "```\n",
    "Attempting to reverse the assignment order (e.g. `92 = name`) will result in a syntax error.  When a variable is assigned an object (like a number or a string), it is common to say that the variable **references** that object. That is, the variable `name` references the string `\"Brian\"`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once a variable is referencing a value, you can use the variable elsewhere in your code as a placeholder:\n",

    "## Valid Names for Variables\n",

    ">>> list1 = [1, 2, 3]  #  `list1` references [1, 2, 3]\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "What this entails is that these common variables will reference the *same instance* of the list. Meaning that if the list changes, all of the variables referencing that list will reflect this change:\n",

    "```\n",

Then any change (a.k.a *mutation*)  of the object will be reflected in all of the variables that reference it (`a`, `b`, and `c`).\n",
