In Python, the term \"object\" is quite the catch-all; including numbers, strings of characters, lists, functions - a Python object is essentially anything that you can assign a variable to. That being said, there are different *types* of objects: Python treats integers as a different *type* of object than a string, for instance. \n",
    "\n",
    "The different object types have manifestly different purposes and thus have different built-in functions available to them. Here, we will review some of basic types that are built-in to Python, as natural entry point to writing code. We will cover:\n",

    "- booleans\n",
    "- the \"null\" type\n",
    "- strings\n",
    "- lists\n",
    "\n",
    "The built-in function `isinstance` will allow us to check if an object is of a given type. You can also use the built-in `type` function to check an object's type. For example, the following code checks if an object is an integer:\n",

    "```python\n",

For instance, the following Python integer is defined with 23 digits, but when this number is converted to a  float, it only retains 16 decimal places in scientific notation:  \n",

    "```\n",
    "The computer cannot keep track of those last 6 decimal places, because doing so would require more than 8 bytes of memory to store the entire value of that float. As such, attempting to modify a number in decimal places beyond its numerical precision does not have any effect:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",

Furthermore, all arithmetic involving decimal numbers from this module is guaranteed to be *exact*, meaning that `0.1 + 0.1 + 0.1 - 0.3` would be exactly `0.`. There is also a built-in [fractions module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/fractions.html#module-fractions), which provides tools for working with exact representations of rational numbers. Although we will not be using them here, is very important to keep in mind that these modules exist and that floating point numbers are not the only way around the number line in Python. "

    "A list object is created using square-brackets, and its contents are separated by commas: `[item1, item2, ..., itemN]`. Its contents need not be of the same type of object.\n",

    "You can also include variables, equations, and other Python expressions in the list constructor; Python will simplify these expressions and construct the list with the resulting objects.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# the list constructor will simplify expressions \n",
    "# and store their resulting objects\n",
    ">>> x = \"hello\"\n",

    "### Lists can be \"mutated\"\n",

    "## Summary\n",
    "The term \"object\" is a catch-all in Python, meaning anything that we can assign a variable to. Objects behave differently from one another according to what \"type\" a given object is. \n",
    "\n",
    "We reviewed several fundamental object types in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `int`, `float`, `complex`: the numerical types\n",
    "- `bool`: the boolean type. `True`, `False` are the only boolean-type objects\n",
    "- `NoneType`: the \"null\" type; `None` is *the only object that belongs to this type*\n",
    "- `str`: the string type\n",
    "- `list`: the list type\n",
    "\n",
    "The built-in function `type` permits us to check the type of any object:\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> type(3.2)\n",
    "float\n",
    "\n",
    ">>> type(True)\n",
    "bool\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The built-in function `isinstance` should be used to check if an object is of a specific type:\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> x = 2 + 3\n",
    ">>> isinstance(x, int)\n",
    "True\n",
    "```\n",
    "The only exception to this is if you want to check if an object is of the type `NoneType`, since this is only possible if the object is  `None`; thus it is \"cleaner\" to directly check this:\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> x = None\n",
    ">>> x is None\n",
    "True\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Objects of different types have different built-in functions available to them:\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> x = \"I am a farmer.. moo\"\n",
    ">>> x.upper()\n",
    "'I AM A FARMER.. MOO'\n",
    "\n",
    ">>> y = 0.5\n",
    ">>> y.as_integer_ratio()\n",
    "(1, 2)\n",
    "```\n",
    "You should leverage the official documentation, for which links were provided throughout this section, whenever you are wondering how to best do a specific task with a given type of object.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a final reminder, we saw that that an integer in Python is able to hold a value with arbitrarily-many digits. A floating-point number, on the other hand, is restricted in the number of \"significant\" digits it can hold. Thus, where it is perfectly fine to check if two integers are exactly equal:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# checking if two integers are equal is great!\n",
    ">>> 2 + 2 == 4\n",

    ">>> 0.1 + 0.1 + 0.1 - 0.3 == 0.\n",
