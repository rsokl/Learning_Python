For instance, the following Python integer is defined with 23 digits, but when this number is converted to a  float, it only retains 16 decimal places in scientific notation:  \n",

Furthermore, all arithmetic involving decimal numbers from this module is guaranteed to be *exact*, meaning that `0.1 + 0.1 + 0.1 - 0.3` would be exactly `0.`. There is also a built-in [fractions module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/fractions.html#module-fractions), which provides tools for working with exact representations of rational numbers. Although we will not be using them here, it is very important to keep in mind that these modules exist and that floating point numbers are not the only way around the number line in Python. "

    "### Introducing the string type\n",
    "The string type is used to store written characters. A string can be formed using:\n",
    "\n",
    "- single quotes: `'Hello world'`\n",
    "- double quotes: `\"Hello world\"`\n",
    "- triple quotes: `\"\"\"Hello world\"\"\"` or `'''Hello world'''` \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Strings contain written characters, even those\n",
    "# not found in the english alphabet!\n",
    ">>> \"hello, 你好, Olá, 123\"\n",
    "'hello, 你好, Olá, 123'\n",
    "```\n",
    "By default, Python 3 uses [UTF-8 unicode](https://docs.python.org/3/howto/unicode.html#unicode-howto) to represent this wide variety of characters. Don't worry about this detail beyond making note of it, for now.\n",
    "\n",
    "Strings belong to the built-in `str` type, which can be used to convert non-string objects into strings:\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> type(\"hello\")\n",
    "str\n",
    "\n",
    ">>> isinstance(\"83\", str)\n",
    "True\n",

    "\n",
    ">>> str(True)\n",
    "'True'\n",
    "```\n",
    "Once a string is formed, it cannot be changed (without creating an entirely new string). Thus a given string object cannot be \"mutated\" - a string is an *immutable* object.\n",
    "\n",
    "As the string stores a *sequence* of characters, Python provides a means for accessing individual characters and subsequences of characters from a string:\n",
    "```python\n",

    "\n",
    "### String essentials\n",

    "# using `\\n` to create a newline\n",
    ">>> print(\"hi...\\n...bye\")\n",
    "hi...\n",
    "...bye\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Using triple quotes allows you to write a block-string, meaning that you can include text on multiple lines, and it is all still treated as one string:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# using triple-quotes to write a multi-line string\n",
    ">>> x = \"\"\" I am a string.\n",
