    "An **iterable** is any Python object capable of returning its members one at a time, permitting it to be iterated over in a for-loop. \n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "Familiar examples of iterables include lists, tuples, strings - any such sequence can be iterated over in a for-loop. We will also encounter important non-sequential collections, like dictionaries and sets; these are iterables as well. It is also possible to have an iterable that \"generates\" each one of its members upon iteration - meaning that it doesn't ever store all of its members in memory at once. We dedicate an entire section to generators, a special type of iterator, because they are so useful for writing efficient code.\n",

    "## \"Tricks for working with iterables\n",
    "Python provides some syntactic \"tricks\" for working with iterables: \"unpacking\" iterables and \"enumerating\" iterables. Although these may seem like inconsequential niceties at first glance, they deserve our attention because they will help us write clean, readable code. Writing clean, readable code helps produce bug-free algorithms that are easy to understand. Furthermore, these tricks will also facilitate the use of other great Python features, like comprehension-statements, which will be introduced in the coming sections.\n",
    "\n",
    "### \"Unpacking\" iterables\n",
    "Suppose that you have three values stored in a list, and that you want to assign a distinct variable to each value. Given the lessons that we have covered thus far, you would likely write the following code:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# simple script for assigning variables to contents of list\n",
    ">>> my_list = [7, 9, 11]\n",
    "\n",
    ">>> x = my_list[0]\n",
    ">>> y = my_list[1]\n",
    ">>> z = my_list[2]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Python provides an extremely useful functionality, known as **iterable unpacking**, which allows us to write the simple, elegant code:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# assigning variables to contents of a list using iterable unpacking\n",
    ">>> my_list = [7, 9, 11]\n",
    "\n",
    ">>> x, y, z = my_list\n",
    ">>> print(x, y, z)\n",
    "7 9 11\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "That is, the Python interpreter \"sees\" the pattern of variables to the left of the assignment, and will \"unpack\" the iterable (which happens to be a list in this instance). It may not seem it from this example, but this is an *extremely* useful feature of Python that greatly facilitates the readability of code! \n",
    "\n",
    "Iterable unpacking is particularly useful in the context of performing for-loops over iterables-of-iterables. For example, suppose we have a list containing tuples of name-grade pairs:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> grades = [(\"Ashley\", 93), (\"Brad\", 95), (\"Cassie\", 84)]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall from the preceding section that if we loop over this list, that the iterate-variable will be assigned to each of these tuples:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "for entry in grades:\n",
    "    print(entry)\n",
    "```\n",
    "will print:\n",
    "```\n",
    "('Ashley', 93)\n",
    "('Brad', 95)\n",
    "('Cassie', 84)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "It is likely that we will want to work with the student's name and their grade independently (e.g. use the name to access a log, and add the grade-value to our class statistics), thus we will need to index into `entry` twice to assign its contents to two separate variables. However, because each iteration of the for-loop involves an assignment of the form `entry = (\"Ashley\", 93)`, we can make use of iterable unpacking!\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# The first iteration of this for-loop performs\n",
    "# the unpacking assignment: name, grade = (\"Ashley\", 93)\n",
    "for name, grade in grades: \n",
    "    # name = \"Ashley\", grade = 93\n",
    "    # name = \"Brad\",   grade = 95\n",
    "    # name = \"Cassie\", grade = 84\n",
    "    print(name)\n",
    "    print(grade)\n",
    "    print(\"\\n\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "prints:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Ashley\n",
    "93\n",
    "\n",
    "Brad \n",
    "95\n",
    "\n",
    "Cassie \n",
    "84\n",
    "```\n",
    "This for-loop code is concise and supremely readable. It is highly recommended that you make use of iterable unpacking in such contexts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Iterable unpacking is not quite as simple as it might seem. What happens if you provide 4 variables to unpack into, but use an iterable containing 10 items? Although what we have covered thus far conveys the most essential use case, it is good to know that [Python provides an even more extensive syntax for unpacking iterables](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3132/#specification). We will also see that unpacking can be useful when creating and using functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-info\">\n",
    "\n",
    "**Takeaway**: \n",
    "\n",
    "Python provides a sleek syntax for \"unpacking\" the contents of an iterable - assigning each item to its own variable. This allows us to write intuitive, highly-readable code when performing a for-loop over a collection of iterables. \n",
