This is a record of all past PLYMI releases and what went into them,
in reverse chronological order.

----------
2022-03-14
----------

Removed the "is palindrome" problem from Module 2.


----------
2022-01-29
----------

- Added a section to Module 3 about drop-in automatic differentiation for NumPy, via the library `MyGrad <https://github.com/rsokl/MyGrad>`_
- Removed instructions for downgrading `jedi` (upstream bug fixed).
- Fixed typos.


----------
2021-02-28
----------

Fixes a syntax error (missing colons) in a code snippet in `a subsection about conditional expressions <https://www.pythonlikeyoumeanit.com/Module2_EssentialsOfPython/ConditionalStatements.html#if,-else,-and-elif>`_.


----------
2021-01-31
----------

Upgrades the tools used to build PLYMI:

- sphinx 3.4.3
- nbsphinx 0.8.1
- jupytext 1.9.1
- sphinx-rtd-theme 0.5.1

Adds a reading comprehension problem in `the section on type-hinting <https://www.pythonlikeyoumeanit.com/Module5_OddsAndEnds/Writing_Good_Code.html#Type-Hinting>`_
to show that ``jedi`` provides annotation-informed autocompletion abilities in notebooks.


----------
2021-01-30
----------

Updated the discussion of `computing pairwise differences <https://www.pythonlikeyoumeanit.com/Module3_IntroducingNumpy/Broadcasting.html#An-Advanced-Application-of-Broadcasting:-Pairwise-Distances>`_
to account for potential floating-point edge cases that can produce "NaNs" as a result.

There is currently an incompatibility between ``jedi 0.18.0`` and IPython, which breaks autocompletion. See `here <https://github.com/ipython/ipython/issues/12740>`_ for more details.
Added temporary callout boxes to the `informal introduction to Python <https://www.pythonlikeyoumeanit.com/Module1_GettingStartedWithPython/Informal_Intro_Python.html>`_ and to
the `introduction to Jupyter notebooks <https://www.pythonlikeyoumeanit.com/Module1_GettingStartedWithPython/Jupyter_Notebooks.html>`_, which instruct readers to remedy this by downgrading jedi.

Fixed a missing plot in the `introduction to Jupyter <https://www.pythonlikeyoumeanit.com/Module1_GettingStartedWithPython/Jupyter_Notebooks.html>`_ section.

Reformatted the `section on IDEs <https://www.pythonlikeyoumeanit.com/Module1_GettingStartedWithPython/Getting_Started_With_IDEs_and_Notebooks.html>`_ and added a description of PyLance.

Add link to `PLYMI's discussion board <https://github.com/rsokl/Learning_Python/discussions>`_.
