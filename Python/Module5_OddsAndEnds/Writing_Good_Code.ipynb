    "## The PEP8 Style Guide to Python Code\n",
    "\n",
    "PEP8 is a design document for the Python community, that specifies a coherent style guide for writing Python code. It touches on a wide array of dos and don'ts when making style decision in your code. Many of these items are exceedingly simple. For example, PEP8 calls for the inclusion of a single whitespace around binary mathematical operators; e.g.:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Do:\n",
    "x = x + 1\n",
    "\n",
    "# Don't:\n",
    "x=x+1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The biggest impact that this document has is that it guides Python users to write similar-looking code. Thus by writing code that adheres to PEP8 will enable others to find your code easy to read, and vice versa. Note that the code you have encountered throughout PLYMI adheres to this style guide.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will make salient some of the PEP8 guidelines that are most pertinent to the variety of code that you have encountered in your reading thus far. That being said, you should take the time to read through [PEP8 in full](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#code-lay-out), and consult it regularly when you write code. It wont take long for you to internalize most of its guidelines. Lastly, note that many [IDEs](https://www.pythonlikeyoumeanit.com/Module1_GettingStartedWithPython/Getting_Started_With_IDEs_and_Notebooks.html) have have tools called linters that will parse your code and warn you when your code is in violation of PE8's guidelines. This is an excellent mechanism for ensuring that your code adheres to this style specification.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Naming Conventions\n",
    "\n",
    "Class names should use the `CamelCase` (a.k.a `CapWords`) formatting convention, whereas functions and variables should use all-lowercase characters in their names. Underscores can be used in longer lowercased names to make them easier to read (i.e. `snake_case`).\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# naming conventions for classes\n",
    "\n",
    "# Do:\n",
    "\n",
    "class Dog:\n",
    "    pass\n",
    "\n",
    "class ShoppingList:\n",
    "    pass\n",
    "\n",
    "# Don't:\n",
    "\n",
    "class dog:\n",
    "    pass\n",
    "\n",
    "class shoppingList:\n",
    "    pass\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# naming conventions for local variables and functions\n",
    "\n",
    "# Do:\n",
    "\n",
    "list_of_students = [\"Alyosha\", \"Biff\", \"Celine\"]\n",
    "\n",
    "def rotate_image(image):\n",
    "    pass\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Don't\n",

    "ListOfStudents = [\"Shmangela\", \"Shmonathan\"]\n",
    "\n",
    "def rotateimage(image):\n",
    "    pass\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To be clear, there is nothing fundamentally correct about using `CamelCasing` for class names and `snake_casing` for functions and variable names. That being said, most Python users expect code to adhere to these conventions and will struggle to understand and use your code if you do not adhere to them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Constants - variables whose values are not to be changed anywhere within the code - should be specified using ALL_CAPS. Underscores can be used for improving readability.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# naming conventions for constants\n",
    "\n",
    "# Do:\n",
    "BOILING_POINT = 100  # celsius\n",
    "\n",
    "# Don't:\n",
    "boiling_point = 100  # celsius \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Variables that are only to be used internally within the code by developers can be signified using a leading underscore. E.g. if you encounter the line of code `_use_gpu = True`, this means that the variable `_use_gpu` is only meant to be viewed and edited by the people who are actually writing the code. Note that this variable will not behave differently from `use_gpu` - the leading underscore is simply a signifier.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use a trailing underscore when your variable name would otherwise conflict with terms reserved by Python. For example you cannot name a variable `class`, as this term is reserved by Python for defining a new class-object. Instead you could name the variable `class_`. This should be used only sparingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Paramount to all of this is that variables are given *descriptive* names.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Do:\n",
    "for temperature in list_of_temperatures:\n",
    "    pressure = gauge(temperature)\n",

    "Type hinting is a syntax that was introduced in Python 3.5 (via [PEP484](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0484/)), which permits users to annotate their function definitions to indicate the object-types of a function's inputs and outputs. For example, let's define a function that counts the number of vowels in a string and annotate the function signature with type-hints. \n",
    "\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we have \"hinted\" that `x` should be passed a string-type object, and that the function will return an integer-type object. The general form of an annotated function, with an arbitrary number of [positional arguments](https://www.pythonlikeyoumeanit.com/Module2_EssentialsOfPython/Functions.html#Arguments) and [default-valued arguments](https://www.pythonlikeyoumeanit.com/Module2_EssentialsOfPython/Functions.html#Default-Valued-Arguments) is as follows:\n",
