Any fundamental changes to the core Python language, the CPython interpreter, or the modules in Python's standard library must first be submitted as a PEP, which goes through an approval process. You can read more about the purposes and guidelines of PEPs [here](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0001/).

    "PEP 8 is a design document for the Python community, that specifies a coherent style guide for writing Python code. It touches on a wide array of dos and don'ts when making style decision in your code. Many of these items are exceedingly simple. For example, PEP 8 calls for the inclusion of a single whitespace around binary mathematical operators; e.g.:\n",

    "The biggest impact that this document has is that it guides Python users to write similar-looking code. Thus by writing code that adheres to PEP8 will enable others to find your code easy to read, and vice versa. Note that the code you have encountered throughout PLYMI adheres to this style guide.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will make salient some of the PEP8 guidelines that are most pertinent to the variety of code that you have encountered in your reading thus far. That being said, you should take the time to read through [PEP 8 in full](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#code-lay-out), and consult it regularly when you write code. It wont take long for you to internalize most of its guidelines. Lastly, note that many [IDEs](https://www.pythonlikeyoumeanit.com/Module1_GettingStartedWithPython/Getting_Started_With_IDEs_and_Notebooks.html) have have tools called linters that will parse your code and warn you when your code is in violation of PE8's guidelines.

    "Variables that are only to be used internally within the code by developers can be signified using a leading underscore. E.g. if you encounter the line of code `_use_gpu = True`, this means that the variable `_use_gpu` is only meant to be viewed and edited by the people who are actually writing the code. Note that this variable will not behave differently from `use_gpu` - the leading underscore is simply a signifier.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use a trailing underscore when your variable name would otherwise conflict with terms reserved by Python.

They will warn you when you pass objects to your function that do not abide by the type hints, and they will also leverage these annotations to keep track of the objects that are returned by the function. \n",

    "### Using the `typing` Module\n",
    "Although we can use Python's built-int type objects (e.g. `list` and `dict`) for type-hinting, the standard library's [typing](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html) module provides objects that are used to form more descriptive hints. For example, suppose that we want to write a function that takes in a list of integers as an input. Using the built-in `list` object for our type-hint prevents us from indicating that the list should house integers. `typing.List`, on the otherhand, supports a richer syntax for type-hinting: `typing.List[int]` specifies \"a list of integers\". Familiarizing yourself with the `typing` module is the first step to writing good type hints.\n",

Next, note that `Optional[List[str]]` is used to indicate that the default-value of `student_list` is `None`, but that we can otherwise pass it a list-of-strings.
