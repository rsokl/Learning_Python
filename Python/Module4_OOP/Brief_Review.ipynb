    "## A Brief Summary of Terms and Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's do a quick rundown of some of the concepts and terms discussed thus far.  The following code is a *class definition*, which specifies the *attributes* of objects that belong to the class/type `Example`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Example:\n",
    "    a = (1, 2, 3)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    def __init__(self):\n",
    "        self.b = \"apple\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Once executed, this code produces the *class object* `Example`, which encapsulates the above definition and can be used to create objects that are instances of this class/type. `Example.a` and `Example.__init__` are both attributes of this class. `Example.__init__` is more specifically a special method, which is automatically invoked whenever an instance of this class is created. \n",
    "\n",
    "The following code creates an *instance* of `Example`, assigning that instance to the variable `ex`. This means that the object belongs to the type (a.k.a class) `Example`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> ex = Example()\n",
    "\n",
    ">>> Example.a\n",
    "(1, 2, 3)\n",
    "\n",
    ">>> ex.a\n",
    "(1, 2, 3)\n",
    "\n",
    ">>> isinstance(ex, Example)\n",
    "True\n",
    "\n",
    ">>> type(ex)\n",
    "__main__.Example\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Upon this instantiation, the instance-level attribute `b` was defined via execution of the `__init__` method, wherein Python passed the instance object being created as the argument `self` to the method. Thus `b` is an *instance-level* attribute, which is not possessed by `Example` itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> Example.b\n",
    "AttributeError: type object 'Example' has no attribute 'b'\n",
    "\n",
    ">>> ex.b\n",
    "'apple'\n",
    "```\n"
