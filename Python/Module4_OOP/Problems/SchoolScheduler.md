# Designing a School Scheduling System
All schools require some system to keep track of student schedules. The simplest possible means of doing this would be to use a dictionary to store an list of class names using the student's name as the key, but this would make changing class schedules tedious and computationally expensive. Instead, it would be far more effective and efficient for us to store the requisite information in classes designed to store information on students, teachers, class sections and courses. 

To begin, let us consider the structure of this problem. Our goal is to organize and maintain a set of student records containing their `name`, `ID number`, `grade_level`, and a 'class schedule'. The class schedule is a list of 'sections' each of which needs to record the `course` that is being offered, as well as the `teacher`, `room number`, and the `period` in which the class is offered.   

We could accomplish this by storing a list of `section` objects inside of each `student` object, but imagine what would need to happen if a school administrator wanted to change the room number of a class section. Our system would need to check every student's schedule in order to find each instance of the relevant section and make a change to each. Instead, if we simply stored a list of students under each section, a change of this sort would only take a single operation. Similarly, we can organize all sections of the same course under a single `course` object in order to reduce repeated information about the course such as the `department`, `name`, and `course_id`.

### Framework

From a top down persepective, we will aim to organize our `Course`, `Section`, `Teacher`, and `Student` objects like this:

```
|-------------------------------|       |-------------------------------|  
|  Course                       |       |  Course                       |
|-------------------------------|       |-------------------------------|  
|  -----------     -----------  |       |  -----------     -----------  |  
| | Section   |   | Section   | |       | | Section   |   | Section   | | 
| |-----------|   |-----------| |       | |-----------|   |-----------| |
| | Teacher   |   | Teacher   | |       | | Teacher   |   | Teacher   | |
| |           |   |           | |       | |           |   |           | |
| | [Student, |   | [Student, | |       | | [Student, |   | [Student, | |
| |  Student, |...|  Student, | |  ...  | |  Student, |...|  Student, | |
| |  ...,     |   |  ...,     | |       | |  ...,     |   |  ...,     | |
| |  Student] |   |  Student] | |       | |  Student] |   |  Student] | |
|  -----------     -----------  |       |  -----------     -----------  |
|                               |       |                               |
|-------------------------------|       |-------------------------------|
```

### Part 1: Define classes and `__init__` functions

To begin, create the following four classes with the specified parameters, and an `__init__` function to initialize each according to the following function headers:

- `Student`
     - Stores `name`, `id`, and `grade`
 - `Teacher`
     - Stores `name`, `id`, and `dept`
 - `Section`
     - Stores `course_id`, `period`, `teacher` (which holds a `Teacher` object), `room`, and `students` (which holds `[Students]` and defaults to None)
 - `Course`
     - Stores `name`, `dept`, `id`, and `sections`(which stores `[Section]` and defaults to None)

```python
class Student:
    def __init__(self, student_name, student_id, grade_level):
        """ Parameters
            ----------
            student_name: str
                Name of the student
            student_id: int
                Unique ID number of the student
            grade_level: int
                Grade level of the student (1-12)
        """
class Teacher:
    def __init__(self, teacher_name, teacher_id, department):
        """ Parameters
            ----------
            teacher_name: str
                Name of the teacher

                Unique ID number of the teacher
            department: str
                Name of the teacher's department
        """
class Section:
    def __init__(self, course_id, period_num, room_num, teacher, student_list = None):
        """ Parameters
            ----------
            course_id: int
                The course_id associated with this section's Course object
            period_num: int
                Number of the period in which this section is offered (1-6)
            room_num: int
                The number of the room
            teacher: Teacher
                The object representing the teacher leading the section
            student_list: Iterable[Student]
                Iterable of Student objects who are enrolled in this Section
                (defaults to None)
        """   
class Course:
    def __init__(self, course_name, course_id, department, section_list = None):
        """ Parameters
            ----------
            course_name: str
                Name of the course
            course_id: int
                Unique ID number of the course
            department: str
                Department in which the course is offered
            section_list: Iterable[Section]
                Iterable of Section objects offered for the Course
                (defaults to None)
        """
```


 
<!-- #endregion -->

### Part 2: Define `__eq__` functions for each  class

In the next section we will need to compare objects to one another in order to remove them from a list using the `remove()` function or to check equality in later functions. In Python, objects are compared using the special method `__eq__`, which returns `True` if two objects are equal by any definition we choose to use, and `False` otherwise.

Add a function with the header `__eq__(self, other)` to all classes, and find a way to compare them as described above. 

*[Hint: For many (but not all) of the classes, there is an easily accessible unique identifier.]*


<!-- #region -->
### Part 3: Basic Class Methods

Next, we want to be able to add and remove items from the lists we defined in the course and section classes, as well as run a couple of brief utility functions to check a property of the lists that we create. Add the following functions to the indicated classes:

*[Note: add_section creates a new Section object, while add_student adds an already existing Student object. This is because anytime a user of this system creates a Section, it should be added automatically to the list of secions for that course, but Student objects persist and can be added to several sections, so it does not make sense to create a student object in add_student]*

**Course**

```python
def add_section(self, period, room, teacher):
    """ Creates a section and adds it to the sections list
        
        Parameters
        ----------
        period: int
            period of the section to add (1-6)
        room: int
            The number of the room
        teacher: Teacher

    """

def remove_section(self, period, room):
    """ Removes a section from the sections list

        ----------
        period: int
            period of the section to remove (1-6)

            The number of the room
    """
    
def avg_grade_level(self):
    """ Retruns the average grade level of the students in the section

        ----------
        None

        Returns
        ----------

**Section**

```python

        """ Adds a student to the students list
        
            Parameters
            ----------

### Part 4: Student Schedules and Class Conflicts

Now that our classes have been created with the specified parameters and functions, weâ€™re ready to start designing the functionality of the platform.

Implement the following functions (along with any helper functions you may choose to use) in a new `Catalog` class which maintains a dictionary of Courses, stored under the department name as its key:

```python
class Catalog:
    def __init__(self, year, course_list):
        """ Parameters
            ----------
            year: int
                The year for this Course Catalog
            course_list: Iterable[Course]
                Iterable of Course objects offered in the given year
        """
    
    def all_sections(self):
        """ Returns a list of all sections from all courses
            
            Parameters
            ----------
            None
                
            Returns
            ----------
            Iterable[Section]
        """
        
    def make_student_schedule(self, student):
        """ Returns a list containing the Section objects for a specific student in order
            of their period (1-6), such that schedule[0] is the students  P1 section,
            and schedule[5] is the students last class. Free periods should be given 
            with a None if a student is not registered in any section for that period.
            
            Parameters
            ----------
            student: Student
                The Student object to generate the schedule for
                
            Returns
            ----------
            Iterable[Section]
                Iterable of Section objects in the student's schedule
        """
    
    def no_class_conflicts(self):
        """ Returns False if there are two sections in the same room at the same period
            or if two sections have the same teacher for the same period, 
            and returns True if no such conflicts exist.
            
            Parameters
